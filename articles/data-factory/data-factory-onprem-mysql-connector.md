# Move data From MySQL using Azure Data Factory

This article outlines how you can use the Copy Activity in an Azure data factory to move data to from MySQL to another data store. This article builds on the [data movement activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) article which presents a general overview of data movement with copy activity and supported data store combinations.

Data Factory service supports connecting to on-premises MySQL sources using the Data Management Gateway. See [moving data between on-premises locations and cloud](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md) article to learn about Data Management Gateway and step-by-step instructions on setting up the gateway. 

**Note:** You need to leverage the gateway to connect to MySQL even if it is hosted in Azure IaaS VMs. If you are trying to connect to an instance of MySQL hosted in cloud, you can also install the gateway instance in the IaaS VM.

Data factory currently supports only moving data from MySQL to other data stores, but not for moving data from other data stores to MySQL.

## Installation 
For Data Management Gateway to connect to the MySQL Database, you need to install the [MySQL Connector/Net 6.6.5 for Microsoft Windows](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=278885) on the same system as the Data Management Gateway.

## Sample: Copy data from MySQL to Azure Blob

The sample below shows:

1.	A linked service of type [OnPremisesMySql](data-factory-onprem-mysql-connector.md#mysql-linked-service-properties).
2.	A linked service of type [AzureStorage](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-storage-linked-service-properties).
3.	An input [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [RelationalTable](data-factory-onprem-mysql-connector.md#mysql-dataset-type-properties).
4.	An output [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureBlob](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-dataset-type-properties).
4.	A [pipeline](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) with Copy Activity that uses [RelationalSource](data-factory-onprem-mysql-connector.md#mysql-copy-activity-type-properties) and [BlobSink](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-copy-activity-type-properties).

The sample copies data from a query result in MySQL database to a blob every hour. The JSON properties used in these samples are described in sections following the samples. 

As a first step, please setup the data management gateway as per the instructions in the [moving data between on-premises locations and cloud](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md) article. 

**MySQL linked service**

	{
	  "name": "OnPremMySqlLinkedService",
	  "properties": {
	    "type": "OnPremisesMySql",
	    "typeProperties": {
	      "server": "<server name>",
	      "database": "<database name>",
	      "schema": "<schema name>",
	      "authenticationType": "<authentication type>",
	      "userName": "<user name>",
	      "password": "<password>",
	      "gatewayName": "<gateway>"
	    }
	  }
	}

**Azure Storage linked service**

	{
	  "name": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
	  "properties": {
	    "type": "AzureStorage",
	    "typeProperties": {
	      "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<accountname>;AccountKey=<accountkey>"
	    }
	  }
	}

**MySQL input dataset**

The sample assumes you have created a table “MyTable” in MySQL and it contains a column called “timestampcolumn” for time series data.

Setting “external”: ”true” and specifying externalData policy informs the Data Factory service that the table is external to the data factory and not produced by an activity in the data factory.
	
	{
	    "name": "MySqlDataSet",
	    "properties": {
	        "published": false,
	        "type": "RelationalTable",
	        "linkedServiceName": "OnPremMySqlLinkedService",
	        "typeProperties": {},
	        "availability": {
	            "frequency": "Hour",
	            "interval": 1
	        },
			"external": true,
	        "policy": {
	            "externalData": {
	                "retryInterval": "00:01:00",
	                "retryTimeout": "00:10:00",
	                "maximumRetry": 3
	            }
	        }
	    }
	}



**Azure Blob output dataset**

Data is written to a new blob every hour (frequency: hour, interval: 1). The folder path for the blob is dynamically evaluated based on the start time of the slice that is being processed. The folder path uses year, month, day, and hours parts of the start time.

	            },
	            "partitionedBy": [
	                {
	                    "name": "Year",
	                    "value": {
	                        "type": "DateTime",
	                        "date": "SliceStart",
	                        "format": "yyyy"
	                    }
	                },
	                {
	                    "name": "Month",
	                    "value": {
	                        "type": "DateTime",
	                        "date": "SliceStart",
	                        "format": "%M"
	                    }
	                },
	                {
	                    "name": "Day",
	                    "value": {
	                        "type": "DateTime",
	                        "date": "SliceStart",
	                        "format": "%d"
	                    }
	                },
	                {

	                    "value": {
	                        "type": "DateTime",
	                        "date": "SliceStart",
	                        "format": "%H"
	                    }
	                }
	            ]
	        },

	            "interval": 1
	        }
	    }
	}



**Pipeline with Copy activity**

The pipeline contains a Copy Activity that is configured to use the above input and output datasets and is scheduled to run every hour. In the pipeline JSON definition, the **source** type is set to **RelationalSource** and **sink** type is set to **BlobSink**. The SQL query specified for the **query** property selects the data in the past hour to copy.

See [Setting Credentials and Security](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md#setting-credentials-and-security) for details about setting credentials for an on-premises MySQL data source.

## MySQL Dataset type properties

For a full list of sections & properties available for defining datasets, see the [Creating datasets](data-factory-create-datasets.md) article. Sections like structure, availability, and policy of a dataset JSON are similar for all dataset types (Azure SQL, Azure blob, Azure table, etc...).

The **typeProperties** section is different for each type of dataset and provides information about the location of the data in the data store. The typeProperties section for dataset of type **RelationalTable** (which includes MySQL dataset) has the following properties

| Property | Description | Required |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| tableName | Name of the table in the MySQL Database instance that linked service refers to. | Yes | 

## MySQL Copy Activity type properties

For a full list of sections & properties available for defining activities, see the [Creating Pipelines](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) article. Properties like name, description, input and output tables, various policies etc. are available for all types of activities. 

Properties available in the typeProperties section of the activity on the other hand vary with each activity type and in case of Copy activity they vary depending on the types of sources and sinks.

In case of Copy Activity when source is of type **RelationalSource** (which includes MySQL) the following properties are available in typeProperties section:

| Property | Description | Allowed values | Required |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------- | -------- |
| query | Use the custom query to read data. | SQL query string. For example: select * from MyTable. | Yes | 

[AZURE.INCLUDE [data-factory-structure-for-rectangualr-datasets](../../includes/data-factory-structure-for-rectangualr-datasets.md)]

### Type mapping for MySQL

As mentioned in the [data movement activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) article, Copy activity performs automatic type conversions from source types to sink types with the following 2 step approach:

1. Convert from native source types to .NET type
2. Convert from .NET type to native sink type

When moving data to MySQL the following mappings will be used from MySQL types to .NET types.

| MySQL Database type | .NET Framework type |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | 
| bigint unsigned | Decimal |
| bigint | Int64 |
| bit | Decimal |
| blob | Byte[] |
| bool |  Boolean | 
| char | String |
| date | Datetime |
| datetime | Datetime |
| decimal | Decimal |
| double precision | Double |
| double | Double |
| enum | String |
| float | Single |
| int unsigned | Int64 |
| int | Int32 |
| integer unsigned | Int64 |
| integer | Int32 | 
| long varbinary | Byte[] |
| long varchar | String |
| longblob | Byte[] |
| longtext | String | 
| mediumblob | 	Byte[] | 
| mediumint unsigned | Int64 |
| mediumint | Int32 | 
| mediumtext | String |
| numeric | Decimal |
| real |  Double |
| set | String |
| smallint unsigned | Int32 |
| smallint | Int16 |
| text | String |
| time | TimeSpan |
| timestamp | Datetime |
| tinyblob | Byte[] |
| tinyint unsigned |  Int16 | 
| tinyint | Int16 |
| tinytext | String | 
| varchar | String | 
| year | Int |
