#  Application Insights: Code Samples and Walkthroughs

*Application Insights is in preview.*

This is a compilation of code samples that show you how to use [Visual Studio Application Insights](app-insights-get-started.md).

## SDK Labs

[SDK Labs](https://www.myget.org/gallery/applicationinsights-sdk-labs) is a collection of experimental NuGet packages that you can install and uninstall as additions to your Application Insights SDK. Try them out and give us feedback!

## Web services

* [Add telemetry to Azure web and worker roles](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/tree/master/Samples/AzureEmailService).
* [Windows 8.1 Universal app](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/tree/master/Samples/Windows%208.1%20Universal/)

## Continuous Export

To analyze telemetry data with your own tools, [export it](app-insights-export-telemetry.md) to storage, where you can parse and process it.

* [Export to Power BI](app-insights-export-power-bi.md) 
* [Export to SQL using a worker role](app-insights-code-sample-export-telemetry-sql-database.md)
* [Export to SQL using Stream Analytics](app-insights-code-sample-export-sql-stream-analytics.md)
* [Enabling telemetry for Microsoft CRM](app-insights-sample-mscrm.md)
