# Power BI views of Application Insights data

[Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) presents your data in rich and varied visuals, with the ability to bring together information from multiple sources. You can stream telemetry data about the performance and usage of your web or device apps from Application Insights to Power BI.

![Sample of Power BI view of Application Insights usage data](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/010.png)

In this article, we'll show how to export data from Application Insights and use Stream Analytics to move the data into Power BI. [Stream Analytics](http://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics/) is an Azure service that we'll use as an adaptor.

## Monitor your app with Application Insights

If you haven't tried it yet, now is the time to start. Application Insights can monitor any device or web app on a wide range of platforms, including Windows, iOS, Android, J2EE, and more. [Get started](app-insights-get-started.md).

## Create storage in Azure

Continuous export always outputs data to an Azure Storage account, so you need to create the storage first.

1. Create a storage account in your subscription in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

    ![In Azure portal, choose New, Data, Storage](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/030.png)

2. Create a container

    ![In the new storage, select Containers and then Add](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/040.png)

3. Copy the storage access key

    You'll need it soon to set up the input to the stream analytics service.

    ![In the storage, open Settings, Keys, and take a copy of the Primary Access Key](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/045.png)

## Start continuous export to Azure storage

[Continuous export](app-insights-export-telemetry.md) moves data from Application Insights into Azure storage.

1. In the Azure portal, browse to the Application Insights resource you created for your application.

    ![Choose Browse, Application Insights, your application](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/050.png)

2. Create a continuous export.

    ![Choose Settings, Continuous Export, Add](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/060.png)


    Select the storage account you created earlier:

    ![Set the export destination](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/070.png)
    
    Set the event types you want to see:

    ![Choose event types](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/080.png)

3. Let some data accumulate. Sit back and let people use your application for a while. Telemetry will come in and you'll see statistical charts in [metric explorer](app-insights-metrics-explorer.md) and individual events in [diagnostic search](app-insights-diagnostic-search.md). 

    And also, the data will export to your storage. 

4. Inspect the exported data. In Visual Studio, choose **View / Cloud Explorer**, and open Azure / Storage. (If you don't have this menu option, you need to install the Azure SDK: Open the New Project dialog and open Visual C# / Cloud / Get Microsoft Azure SDK for .NET.)

    ![](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/04-data.png)

    Make a note of the common part of the path name, which is derived from the application name and instrumentation key. 

The events are written to blob files in JSON format. Each file may contain one or more events. So we'd like to read the event data and filter out the fields we want. There are all kinds of things we could do with the data, but our plan today is to use Stream Analytics to pipe the data to Power BI.

## Create an Azure Stream Analytics instance

From the [Classic Azure Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/), select the Azure Stream Analytics service, and create a new Stream Analytics job:


![](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/090.png)



![](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/100.png)

When the new job is created, expand its details:

![](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/110.png)


#### Set blob location

Set it to take input from your Continuous Export blob:

![](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/120.png)

Now you'll need the Primary Access Key from your Storage Account, which you noted earlier. Set this as the Storage Account Key.

![](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/130.png)

#### Set path prefix pattern 

![](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/140.png)


Be sure to set the Date Format to YYYY-MM-DD (with dashes).

The Path Prefix Pattern specifies where Stream Analytics finds the input files in the storage. You need to set it to correspond to how Continuous Export stores the data. Set it like this:

    webapplication27_12345678123412341234123456789abcdef0/PageViews/{date}/{time}

In this example:

* `webapplication27` is the name of the Application Insights resource **all lower case**.
* `1234...` is the instrumentation key of the Application Insights resource, **omitting dashes**. 
* `PageViews` is the type of data you want to analyze. The available types depend on the filter you set in Continuous Export. Examine the exported data to see the other available types, and see the [export data model](app-insights-export-data-model.md).
* `/{date}/{time}` is a pattern written literally.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Inspect the storage to make sure you get the path right.

#### Finish initial setup

Confirm the serialization format:

![Confirm and close wizard](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/150.png)

Close the wizard and wait for the setup to complete.

## Set the output

Now select your job and set the output.

![Select the new channel, click Outputs, Add, Power BI](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/160.png)

Authorize Stream Analytics to access your Power BI resource, and then create a name for the output, and for the target Power BI dataset and table.

![Invent three names](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/170.png)

## Set the query

The query governs the translation from input to output.

![Select the job and click Query. Paste the sample below.](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/180.png)

Paste this query:

```SQL

    SELECT
      flat.ArrayValue.name,
      count(*)
    INTO
      [pbi-output]
    FROM
      [export-input] A
    OUTER APPLY GetElements(A.[event]) as flat
    GROUP BY TumblingWindow(minute, 1), flat.ArrayValue.name
```

* export-input is the alias we gave to the stream input
* pbi-output is the output alias we defined
* We use GetElements because the event name is in a nested JSON arrray. Then the Select picks the event name, together with a count of the number of instances with that name in the time period. The Group By clause groups the elements into time periods of 1 minute.

## Run the job

You can select a date in the past to start the job from. 

![Select the job and click Query. Paste the sample below.](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/190.png)

Wait until the job is Running.

## See results in Power BI

Open Power BI and select the dataset and table that you defined as the output of the Stream Analytics job.

![In Power BI, select your dataset and fields.](./media/app-insights-export-power-bi/200.png)

Now you can use this dataset in reports and dashboards in [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com).
