# Use mobile app as your contact method with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication

If you want to use the mobile app as your primary contact method you can use this article.  It will walk you through setting up multi-factor authentication to use your mobile app as your primary contact method.

The Azure Authenticator app is available for [Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/azure-authenticator/03a5b2bf-6066-418f-b569-e8aecbc06e50), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator), and [IOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/azure-authenticator/id983156458).

## To use a mobile app as your contact method


- Select Mobile App from the drop-down.

- Select either Notification or One-time password and click Set up.
- On the phone that has the Azure Authenticator app installed, launch the app and click scan barcode.  To add an account that already has Azure MFA or a 3rd party account see [Adding an account manually](#adding-an-account-manually).

- Now it is recommended that enter your mobile phone number in case you lose access to your mobile app.
- Specify your country from the drop-down and enter your mobile phone number in the box next to country.  Click Next.
- At this point, you have setup your contact method and now it is time to setup app passwords for non-browser apps such as Outlook 2010 or older. If you do not use these apps click **Done**.  Otherwise continue to the next step.

Now if you have an account that already has Azure MFA, enter the code and the url that is provided on the same page that shows you the barcode.  This goes in the code and url boxes on the mobile app.  This will begin the activation.
