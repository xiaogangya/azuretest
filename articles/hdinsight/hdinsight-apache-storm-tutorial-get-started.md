# Apache Storm tutorial: Get started with the Storm Starter samples for big data analytics on HDInsight

Apache Storm is a scalable, fault-tolerant, distributed, real-time computation system for processing streams of data. With Storm on Azure HDInsight, you can create a cloud-based Storm cluster that performs big data analytics in real time.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [preview-portal](../../includes/hdinsight-azure-preview-portal-nolink.md)]

## Before you begin

You must have the following to successfully complete this Apache Storm tutorial:

- **An Azure subscription**. See [Get Azure free trial](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/videos/get-azure-free-trial-for-testing-hadoop-in-hdinsight/).

## Create a Storm cluster

Storm on HDInsight uses Azure Blob storage for storing log files and topologies submitted to the cluster. Use the following steps to create an Azure Storage account for use with your cluster:

1. Sign in to the [Azure Preview Portal][preview-portal].

2. Select **NEW**, select __Data Analytics__, and then select __HDInsight__

	![Creating a new cluster in the Azure Preview Portal](./media/hdinsight-apache-storm-tutorial-get-started/new-cluster.png)

3. Enter a __Cluster Name__, then select __Storm__ for the __Cluster Type__. A green check will appear beside the __Cluster Name__ if it is available.

	![Cluster name, cluster type, and OS Type](./media/hdinsight-apache-storm-tutorial-get-started/clustername.png)

4. If you have more than one subscription, select the __Subscription__ entry to select the Azure subscription that will be used for the cluster.

5. For __Resource Group__, you can select the entry to see a list of existing resource groups and then select the one to create the cluster in. Or you can select __Create New__ and then enter the name of the new resource group. A green check will appear to indicate if the new group name is available.

	> [AZURE.NOTE] This entry will default to one of your existing resource groups, if any are available.

6. Select __Credentials__, then enter a __Cluster Login Username__ and __Cluster Login Password__. Finally, use the __Select__ button to set the credentials. Remote desktop will not be used in this document, so you can leave it disabled.

	![Cluster credentials blade](./media/hdinsight-apache-storm-tutorial-get-started/clustercredentials.png)

6. For __Data Source__, you can select the entry to choose an existing data source, or create a new one.

	![Data source blade](./media/hdinsight-apache-storm-tutorial-get-started/datasource.png)
	
	Currently you can select an Azure Storage Account as the data source for an HDInsight cluster. Use the following to understand the entries on the __Data Source__ blade.
	
	- __Selection Method__: Set this to __From all subscriptions__ to enable browsing of storage accounts on your subscriptions. Set to __Access Key__ if you want to enter the __Storage Name__ and __Access Key__ of an existing storage account.
	
	- __Create New__: Use this to create a new storage account. Use the field that appears to enter the name of the storage account. A green check will appear if the name is available.
	
	- __Choose Default Container__: Use this to enter the name of the default container to use for the cluster. While you can enter any name here, we recommend using the same name as the cluster so that you can easily recognize that the container is used for this specific cluster.
	
	- __Location__: The geographic region that the storage account will be is in, or will be created in.
	
		> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Selecting the location for the default data source will also set the location of the HDInsight cluster. The cluster and default data source must be located in the same region.
		
	- __Select__: Use this to save the data source configuration.
	
7. Select __Node Pricing Tiers__ to display information about the nodes that will be created for this cluster. By default, the number of worker nodes will be set to __4__. Set this to __1__, as this will be sufficient for this tutorial and will reduce the cost of the cluster. The estimated cost of the cluster will be shown at the bottom of this blade.

	![Node pricing tiers blade](./media/hdinsight-apache-storm-tutorial-get-started/nodepricingtiers.png)
	
	Use the __Select__ button to save the __Node Pricing Tiers__ information.

8. Select __Optional Configuration__. This blade allows you to select the cluster version, as well as configure other optional settings such as joining a __Virtual Network__ or setting up an __External Metastore__ to hold data for Hive and Oozie.

	![Optional configuration blade](./media/hdinsight-apache-storm-tutorial-get-started/optionalconfiguration.png)

9. Ensure that __Pin to Startboard__ is selected, and then select __Create__. This will create the cluster and add a tile for it to the Startboard of your Azure Portal. The icon will indicate that the cluster is provisioning, and will change to display the HDInsight icon once provisioning has completed.

	| While provisioning | Provisioning complete |
	| ------------------ | --------------------- |
	| ![Provisioning indicator on startboard](./media/hdinsight-apache-storm-tutorial-get-started/provisioning.png) | ![Provisioned cluster tile](./media/hdinsight-apache-storm-tutorial-get-started/provisioned.png) |

	> [AZURE.NOTE] It will take some time for the cluster to be created, usually around 15 minutes. Use the tile on the Startboard, or the __Notifications__ entry on the left of the page to check on the provisioning process.

##Run a Storm Starter sample on HDInsight

This Apache Storm tutorial introduces you to big data analytics using the Storm Starter samples on GitHub.

Each Storm on HDInsight cluster comes with the Storm Dashboard, which can be used to upload and run Storm topologies on the cluster. Each cluster also comes with sample topologies that can be run directly from the Storm Dashboard.

###<a id="connect"></a>Connect to the dashboard

The dashboard is located at **https://&lt;clustername>.azurehdinsight.net//**, where **clustername** is the name of the cluster. You can also find a link to the dashboard by selecting the cluster from the Startboard and selecting the __Dashboard__ link at the top of the blade.

![Azure portal with Storm Dashboard link](./media/hdinsight-apache-storm-tutorial-get-started/dashboard.png)

> [AZURE.NOTE] When connecting to the dashboard, you will be prompted to enter a user name and password. This is the administrator name (**admin**) and password used when you created the cluster.

Once the Storm Dashboard has loaded, you will see the **Submit Topology** form.

![Submit your Storm Starter topology with the Storm Dashboard.](./media/hdinsight-apache-storm-tutorial-get-started/submit.png)

The **Submit Topology** form can be used to upload and run .jar files containing Storm topologies. It also includes several basic samples that are provided with the cluster.

###<a id="run"></a>Run the word-count sample from the Storm Starter project in GitHub

The samples provided with the cluster include several variations of a word-counting topology. These samples include a **spout** that randomly emits sentences, and **bolts** that break each sentence into individual words, then count how many times each word has occurred. These samples are from the [Storm Starter samples](https://github.com/apache/storm/tree/master/examples/storm-starter), which are a part of Apache Storm.

Perform the following steps to run a Storm Starter sample:

1. Select **StormStarter - WordCount** from the **Jar File** drop-down. This should populate the **Class Name** and **Additional Parameters** fields with the parameters for this sample.

	![Storm Starter WordCount selected on Storm Dashboard.](./media/hdinsight-apache-storm-tutorial-get-started/submit.png)

	* **Class Name** - The class in the .jar file that submits the topology.
	* **Additional Parameters** - Any parameters required by the topology. In this example, the field is used to provide a friendly name for the submitted topology.

2. Click the **Submit** button. After a moment, the **Result** field will display the command used to submit the job, as well as the results of the command. The **Error** field will display any errors that occur in submitting the topology.

	![Submit button and results of Storm Starter WordCount.](./media/hdinsight-apache-storm-tutorial-get-started/submit-results.png)

	> [AZURE.NOTE] The results do not indicate that the topology has finished - **a Storm topology, once started, runs until you stop it.** The word-count topology will generate random sentences, and keep a count of how many times it encounters each word, until you stop it.

###<a id="monitor"></a>Monitor the topology

The Storm UI can be used to monitor the topology.

1. Select **Storm UI** from the top of the Storm Dashboard. This will display summary information for the cluster and all running topologies.

	![Storm dashboard showing the Storm Starter WordCount topology summary.](./media/hdinsight-apache-storm-tutorial-get-started/stormui.png)

	From the page above, you can see the time the topology has been active, as well as the number of workers, executors, and tasks being used.

	> [AZURE.NOTE] The **Name** column contains the friendly name supplied earlier via the **Additional Parameters** field.

4. Under **Topology summary**, select the **wordcount** entry in the **Name** column. This will display more information about the topology.

	![Storm Dashboard with Storm Starter WordCount topology information.](./media/hdinsight-apache-storm-tutorial-get-started/topology-summary.png)

	This page provides the following information:

	* **Topology stats** - Basic information on the topology performance, organized into time windows.

		> [AZURE.NOTE] Selecting a specific time window changes the time window for information displayed in other sections of the page.

	* **Spouts** - Basic information about spouts, including the last error returned by each spout.

	* **Bolts** - Basic information about bolts.

	* **Topology configuration** - Detailed information about the topology configuration.

	This page also provides actions that can be taken on the topology:

	* **Activate** - Resumes processing of a deactivated topology.

	* **Deactivate** - Pauses a running topology.

	* **Rebalance** - Adjusts the parallelism of the topology. You should rebalance running topologies after you have changed the number of nodes in the cluster. This allows the topology to adjust parallelism to compensate for the increased/decreased number of nodes in the cluster. For more information, see [Understanding the parallelism of a Storm topology](http://storm.apache.org/documentation/Understanding-the-parallelism-of-a-Storm-topology.html).

	* **Kill** - Terminates a Storm topology after the specified timeout.

5. From this page, select an entry from the **Spouts** or **Bolts** section. This will display information about the selected component.

	![Storm Dachborad with information about selected components.](./media/hdinsight-apache-storm-tutorial-get-started/component-summary.png)

	This page displays the following information:

	* **Spout/Bolt stats** - Basic information on the component performance, organized into time windows.

		> [AZURE.NOTE] Selecting a specific time window changes the time window for information displayed in other sections of the page.

	* **Input stats** (bolt only) - Information on components that produce data consumed by the bolt.

	* **Output stats** - Information on data emitted by this bolt.

	* **Executors** - Information on instances of this component.

	* **Errors** - Errors produced by this component.

5. When viewing the details of a spout or bolt, select an entry from the **Port** column in the **Executors** section to view details for a specific instance of the component.

		2015-01-27 14:18:02 b.s.d.task [INFO] Emitting: split default ["with"]
		2015-01-27 14:18:02 b.s.d.task [INFO] Emitting: split default ["nature"]
		2015-01-27 14:18:02 b.s.d.executor [INFO] Processing received message source: split:21, stream: default, id: {}, [snow]
		2015-01-27 14:18:02 b.s.d.task [INFO] Emitting: count default [snow, 747293]
		2015-01-27 14:18:02 b.s.d.executor [INFO] Processing received message source: split:21, stream: default, id: {}, [white]
		2015-01-27 14:18:02 b.s.d.task [INFO] Emitting: count default [white, 747293]
		2015-01-27 14:18:02 b.s.d.executor [INFO] Processing received message source: split:21, stream: default, id: {}, [seven]
		2015-01-27 14:18:02 b.s.d.task [INFO] Emitting: count default [seven, 1493957]

	From this data you can see that the word **seven** has occurred 1493957 times. That is how many times it has been encountered since this topology was started.

###Stop the topology

Return to the **Topology summary** page for the word-count topology, and then select the **Kill** button from the **Topology actions** section. When prompted, enter 10 for the seconds to wait before stopping the topology. After the timeout period, the topology will no longer appear when you visit the **Storm UI** section of the dashboard.

##Summary

In this Apache Storm tutorial, you used the Storm Starter to learn how to create a Storm on HDInsight cluster and use the Storm Dashboard to deploy, monitor, and manage Storm topologies.

##<a id="next"></a>Next steps

* **HDInsight Tools for Visual Studio** - HDInsight Tools allows you to use Visual Studio to submit, monitor, and manage Storm topologies similar to the Storm Dashboard mentioned earlier. HDInsight Tools also provides the ability to create C# Storm topologies, and includes sample topologies that you can deploy and run on your cluster.

	For more information, see [Get Started using the HDInsight Tools for Visual Studio](hdinsight-hadoop-visual-studio-tools-get-started.md).

* **Sample files** - The HDInsight Storm cluster provides several examples in the **%STORM_HOME%\contrib** directory. Each example should contain the following:

	* The source code - for example, storm-starter-0.9.1.2.1.5.0-2057-sources.jar

	* The Java docs - for example, storm-starter-0.9.1.2.1.5.0-2057-javadoc.jar

	* The example - for example, storm-starter-0.9.1.2.1.5.0-2057-jar-with-dependencies.jar

	Use the 'jar' command to extract the source code or Java docs. For example, 'jar -xvf storm-starter-0.9.1.2.1.5.0.2057-javadoc.jar'.

	> [AZURE.NOTE] Java docs consist of webpages. Once extracted, use a browser to view the **index.html** file.

	To access these samples, you must enable Remote Desktop for the Storm on HDInsight cluster, and then copy the files from **%STORM_HOME%\contrib**.
