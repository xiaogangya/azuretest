# Install and use Solr on HDInsight Hadoop clusters

You can install Solr on any type of cluster in Hadoop on Azure HDInsight by using **Script Action** cluster customization. Script Action lets you run scripts to customize a cluster, only when the cluster is being created. For more information, see [Customize HDInsight cluster using script action][hdinsight-cluster-customize].

[AZURE.INCLUDE [hdinsight-azure-preview-portal](../../includes/hdinsight-azure-preview-portal.md)]

* [Install Solr on HDInsight clusters](hdinsight-hadoop-solr-install.md)

In this topic, you will learn how to install Solr by using Script Action. Solr is a powerful search platform and provides enterprise-level search capabilities on data managed by Hadoop. Once you have installed Solr on HDInsight cluster, you'll also learn how to search data by using Solr.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The sample script used in this topic creates a Solr cluster with a specific configuration. If you want to configure the Solr cluster with different collections, shards, schemas, replicas, etc., you must modify the script and Solr binaries accordingly.


## <a name="whatis"></a>What is Solr?

<a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/features.html" target="_blank">Apache Solr</a> is an enterprise search platform that enables powerful full-text search on data. While Hadoop enables storing and managing vast amounts of data, Apache Solr provides the search capabilities to quickly retrieve the data. This topic provides instructions on how to customize an HDInsight cluster to install Solr.   

## <a name="install"></a>How do I install Solr?

A sample script to install Solr on an HDInsight cluster is available from a read-only Azure storage blob at [https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/solrconfigactionv01/solr-installer-v01.ps1](https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/solrconfigactionv01/solr-installer-v01.ps1). This section provides instructions on how to use the sample script while provisioning the cluster by using the Azure portal. 


> [AZURE.NOTE] The sample script works only with HDInsight cluster version 3.1. For more information on HDInsight cluster versions, see [HDInsight cluster versions](hdinsight-component-versioning.md).


1. Start provisioning a cluster by using the **CUSTOM CREATE** option, as described at [Provisioning a cluster using custom options](hdinsight-provision-clusters.md#portal). 
2. On the **Script Actions** page of the wizard, click **add script action** to provide details about the script action, as shown below:

	![Use Script Action to customize a cluster](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-solr-install/hdi-script-action-solr.png "Use Script Action to customize a cluster")
	
	<table border='1'>
		<tr><th>Property</th><th>Value</th></tr>
		<tr><td>Name</td>
			<td>Specify a name for the script action. For example, <b>Install Solr</b>.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Script URI</td>
			<td>Specify the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to the script that is invoked to customize the cluster. For example, <i>https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/solrconfigactionv01/solr-installer-v01.ps1</i></td></tr>
		<tr><td>Node Type</td>
			<td>Specify the nodes on which the customization script is run. You can choose <b>All nodes</b>, <b>Head nodes only</b>, or <b>Worker nodes only</b>.
		<tr><td>Parameters</td>
			<td>Specify the parameters, if required by the script. The script to install Solr does not require any parameters, so you can leave this blank.</td></tr>
	</table>	

	You can add more than one script action to install multiple components on the cluster. After you have added the scripts, click the checkmark to start provisioning the cluster.


## <a name="usesolr"></a>How do I use Solr in HDInsight?

You must start with indexing Solr with some data files. You can then use Solr to run search queries on the indexed data. Perform the following steps to use Solr in an HDInsight cluster:

1. **Use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to remote into the HDInsight cluster with Solr installed**. From the Azure portal, enable Remote Desktop for the cluster you created with Solr installed, and then remote into the cluster. For instructions, see <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/hdinsight-administer-use-management-portal/#rdp" target="_blank">Connect to HDInsight clusters using RDP</a>.

2. **Index Solr by uploading data files**. When you index Solr, you put documents in it that you may need to search on. To index Solr, use RDP to remote into the cluster, navigate to the desktop, open the Hadoop command line, and navigate to **C:\apps\dist\solr-4.7.2\example\exampledocs**. Run the following command: 
	
		java -jar post.jar solr.xml monitor.xml

	You'll see the following output on the console:

		POSTing file solr.xml
		POSTing file monitor.xml
		2 files indexed.
		COMMITting Solr index changes to http://localhost:8983/solr/update..
		Time spent: 0:00:01.624

	The post.jar utility indexes Solr with two sample documents, **solr.xml** and **monitor.xml**. The post.jar utility and the sample documents are available with Solr installation.

3. **Use the Solr dashboard to search within the indexed documents**. In the RDP session to the HDInsight cluster, open Internet Explorer, and launch the Solr dashboard at **http://headnodehost:8983/solr/#/**. From the left pane, from the **Core Selector** drop-down, select **collection1**, and within that, click **Query**. As an example, to select and return all the docs in Solr, provide the following values:
	1. In the **q** text box, enter **\*:**\*. This will return all the documents that are indexed in Solr. If you want to search for a specific string within the documents, you can enter that string here.
	2. In the **wt** text box, select the output format. Default is **json**. Click **Execute Query**.

		![Use Script Action to customize a cluster](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-solr-install/hdi-solr-dashboard-query.png "Run a query on Solr dashboard")
	
	The output returns the two docs that we used for indexing Solr. The output resembles the following:

			"response": {
			    "numFound": 2,
			    "start": 0,
			    "maxScore": 1,

			      }
			    ]
			  }
   

4. **Recommended: Back up the indexed data from Solr to Azure Blob storage associated with the HDInsight cluster**. As a good practice, you should back up the indexed data from the Solr cluster nodes onto Azure Blob storage. Perform the following steps to do so:

	1. From the RDP session, open Internet Explorer, and point to the following URL:

			http://localhost:8983/solr/replication?command=backup

		You should see a response like this:

			<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
			<response>
			  <lst name="responseHeader">
			    <int name="status">0</int>
			    <int name="QTime">9</int>
			  </lst>
			  <str name="status">OK</str>
			</response>

	2. In the remote session, navigate to {SOLR_HOME}\{Collection}\data. For the cluster created via the sample script, this should be **C:\apps\dist\solr-4.7.2\example\solr\collection1\data**. At this location, you should see a snapshot folder created with a name similar to **snapshot.*timestamp***.
	
	3. Zip the snapshot folder and upload it to Azure Blob storage. From the Hadoop command line, navigate to the location of the snapshot folder by using the following command:

			  hadoop fs -CopyFromLocal snapshot._timestamp_.zip /example/data

		This command copies the snapshot to /example/data/ under the container within the default Storage account associated with the cluster.
