To help you learn Hadoop on Windows and start using HDInsight, this tutorial shows you how to run a Hive query on unstructured data in a Hadoop cluster and then analyze the results in Microsoft Excel.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [hdinsight-azure-preview-portal](../../includes/hdinsight-azure-preview-portal.md)]

* [Get started with Hadoop in HDInsight on Windows](hdinsight-hadoop-tutorial-get-started-windows-v1.md)

## What does this Hadoop tutorial accomplish?

Assume you have a large unstructured data set and you want to run a Hive query on it to extract some meaningful information. That's exactly what we are going to do in this tutorial. Here's how we achieve this:

   !["Hadoop tutorial: Create an account; provision a Hadoop cluster; submit a Hive query; analyze data in Excel.][image-hdi-getstarted-flow]

Watch a demo video of this tutorial to learn Hadoop on HDInsight:

![Video of a first Hadoop tutorial: Submit a Hive query on a Hadoop cluster, and analyze results in Excel.][img-hdi-getstarted-video]

**[Watch the Hadoop tutorial for HDInsight on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4aNjnoeaHA&list=PLDrz-Fkcb9WWdY-Yp6D4fTC1ll_3lU-QS)**


In conjunction with the general availability of Azure HDInsight, Microsoft also provides HDInsight Emulator for Azure, formerly known as *Microsoft HDInsight Developer Preview*. The Emulator targets developer scenarios and only supports single-node deployments. For information about using HDInsight Emulator, see [Get Started with the HDInsight Emulator][hdinsight-emulator].

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial for Hadoop on Windows, you must have the following:


- **An Azure subscription**. See [Get Azure free trial](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/videos/get-azure-free-trial-for-testing-hadoop-in-hdinsight/).
- **A workstation computer** with Office 2013 Professional Plus, Office 365 Pro Plus, Excel 2013 Standalone, or Office 2010 Professional Plus.


##<a name="provision"></a>Provision a Hadoop cluster

When you provision a cluster, you provision Azure compute resources that contain Hadoop and related applications. In this section, you provision an HDInsight version 3.2 cluster. You can also create Hadoop clusters for other versions. For instructions, see [Provision HDInsight clusters using custom options][hdinsight-provision]. For information about HDInsight versions and their SLAs, see [HDInsight component versioning](hdinsight-component-versioning.md).


**To provision a Hadoop cluster**

1. Sign in to the [Azure Preview Portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/).
2. Click **NEW**, Click **Data Analytics**, and then click **HDInsight**.

    ![Creating a new cluster in the Azure Preview Portal](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-tutorial-get-started-windows/HDI.CreateCluster.1.png "Creating a new cluster in the Azure Preview Portal")

3. Enter a **Cluster Name**, select **Hadoop** for the **Cluster Type**, and from the **Cluster Operating System** drop-down, select **Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter**. A green check will appear beside the cluster name if it is available.

	![Enter cluster name and type](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-tutorial-get-started-windows/HDI.CreateCluster.2.png "Enter cluster name and type")

4. If you have more than one subscription, click the **Subscription** entry to select the Azure subscription that will be used for the cluster.

5. Click **Resource Group** to see a list of existing resource groups and then select the one to create the cluster in. Or, you can click **Create New** and then enter the name of the new resource group. A green check will appear to indicate if the new group name is available.

	> [AZURE.NOTE] This entry will default to one of your existing resource groups, if any are available.

6. Click **Credentials**, then enter a **Cluster Login Username** and **Cluster Login Password**. If you want to enable remote desktop on the cluster node, for **Enable Remote Desktop**, click **Yes**, and then specify the required values. This tutorial does not require remote desktop so you can skip this. Click **Select** at the bottom to save the credentials configuration.

	![Provide cluster credentials](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-tutorial-get-started-windows/HDI.CreateCluster.3.png "Provide cluster credentials")

7. Click **Data Source** to choose an existing data source for the cluster, or create a new one. When you provision a Hadoop cluster in HDInsight, you specify an Azure Storage account. A specific Blob storage container from that account is designated as the default file system, like in the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS). By default, the HDInsight cluster is provisioned in the same data center as the storage account you specify. For more information, see [Use Azure Blob storage with HDInsight][hdinsight-storage]

	![Data source blade](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-tutorial-get-started-windows/HDI.CreateCluster.4.png "Provide data source configuration")
	
	Currently you can select an Azure Storage Account as the data source for an HDInsight cluster. Use the following to understand the entries on the **Data Source** blade.
	
	- **Selection Method**: Set this to **From all subscriptions** to enable browsing of storage accounts from all your subscriptions. Set this to **Access Key** if you want to enter the **Storage Name** and **Access Key** of an existing storage account.
	
	- **Select storage account / Create New**: Click **Select storage account** to browse and select an existing storage account you want to associate with the cluster. Or, click **Create New** to create a new storage account. Use the field that appears to enter the name of the storage account. A green check will appear if the name is available.
	
	- **Choose Default Container**: Use this to enter the name of the default container to use for the cluster. While you can enter any name here, we recommend using the same name as the cluster so that you can easily recognize that the container is used for this specific cluster. 
	
	- **Location**: The geographic region that the storage account is in, or will be created in.
	
		> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Selecting the location for the default data source will also set the location of the HDInsight cluster. The cluster and default data source must be located in the same region.
		
	Click **Select** to save the data source configuration.

8. Click **Node Pricing Tiers** to display information about the nodes that will be created for this cluster. Set the number of worker nodes that you need for the cluster. The estimated cost of the cluster will be shown within the blade.

	![Node pricing tiers blade](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-tutorial-get-started-windows/HDI.CreateCluster.5.png "Specify number of cluster nodes")
	
	Click **Select** to save the node pricing configuration.

9. On the **New HDInsight Cluster** blade, ensure that **Pin to Startboard** is selected, and then click **Create**. This will create the cluster and add a tile for it to the Startboard of your Azure Portal. The icon will indicate that the cluster is provisioning, and will change to display the HDInsight icon once provisioning has completed.

	| While provisioning | Provisioning complete |
	| ------------------ | --------------------- |
	| ![Provisioning indicator on startboard](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-tutorial-get-started-windows/provisioning.png) | ![Provisioned cluster tile](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-tutorial-get-started-windows/provisioned.png) |

	> [AZURE.NOTE] It will take some time for the cluster to be created, usually around 15 minutes. Use the tile on the Startboard, or the **Notifications** entry on the left of the page to check on the provisioning process.

10. Once the provisioning completes, click the tile for the cluster from the Startboard to launch the cluster blade.


##<a name="sample"></a>Run sample data from the portal

A successfully provisioned HDInsight cluster provides a query console that includes a Getting Started gallery to run samples directly from the portal. You can use the samples to learn how to work with HDInsight by walking through some basic scenarios. These samples come with all the required components, such as the data to analyze and the queries to run on the data. To learn more about the samples in the Getting Started gallery, see [Learn Hadoop in HDInsight using the HDInsight Getting Started Gallery](hdinsight-learn-hadoop-use-sample-gallery.md).

**To run the sample**

1. From the Azure preview portal startboard, click the tile for the cluster you just created.
 
2. On the new cluster blade, click **Dashboard**. When prompted, enter the admin username and password for the cluster.

	![Launch cluster dashboard](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-tutorial-get-started-windows/HDI.Cluster.Dashboard.png "Launch cluster dashboard")
 
3. From the webpage that opens, click the **Getting Started Gallery** tab, and then under the **Solutions with Sample Data** category, click the sample that you want to run. Follow the instructions on the Web page to finish the sample. The following table lists a couple of samples and provides more information about what each sample does.

Sample | What does it do?

##<a name="hivequery"></a>Run a Hive query from the portal
Now that you have provisioned an HDInsight cluster, the next step is to run a Hive job to query a sample Hive table. We will use *hivesampletable*, which comes with HDInsight clusters. The table contains data about mobile device manufacturers, platforms, and models. A Hive query on this table retrieves data for mobile devices by a specific manufacturer.

> [AZURE.NOTE] HDInsight Tools for Visual Studio comes with the Azure SDK for .NET version 2.5 or later. By using the tools in Visual Studio, you can connect to HDInsight cluster, create Hive tables, and run Hive queries. For more information, see [Get started using HDInsight Hadoop Tools for Visual Studio][1].

**To run a Hive job from the cluster dashboard**

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal][azure-management-portal].
2. Click **HDINSIGHT** from the left pane. You will see a list of clusters, including the cluster you just created in the previous section.
3. Click the name of the cluster that you want to use to run the Hive job, and then click **QUERY CONSOLE** at the bottom of the page.
4. A webpage opens in a different browser tab. Enter the Hadoop user account and password. The default user name is **admin**; the password is what you entered while provisioning the cluster. The dashboard looks like this:

	![Hive Editor tab in the HDInsight cluster dashboard.][img-hdi-dashboard]

	There are several tabs at the top of the page. The default tab is **Hive Editor**, and the other tabs are **Job History** and **File Browser**. By using the dashboard, you can submit Hive queries, check Hadoop job logs, and browse files in storage.

	> [AZURE.NOTE] Note that the URL of the webpage is *&lt;ClusterName&gt;.azurehdinsight.net*. So instead of opening the dashboard from the portal, you can open the dashboard from a web browser by using the URL.

6. On the **Hive Editor** tab, for **Query Name**, enter **HTC20**.  The query name is the job title. In the query pane, enter the Hive query as shown in the image:

	![Hive query entered in the query pane of the Hive Editor.][img-hdi-dashboard-query-select]

4. Click **Submit**. It takes a few moments to get the results back. The screen refreshes every 30 seconds. You can also click **Refresh** to refresh the screen.

    ![Results from a Hive query in listed at the bottom of the cluster dashboard.][img-hdi-dashboard-query-select-result]

5. After the status shows that the job is completed, click the query name on the screen to see the output. Make a note of **Job Start Time (UTC)**. You will need it later.

    ![Job Start Time listed in the Job History tab of the HDInsight cluster dashboard.][img-hdi-dashboard-query-select-result-output]

    The page also shows the **Job Output** and the **Job Log**. You also have the option to download the output file (\_stdout) and the log file \(_stderr).


**To browse to the output file**

1. On the cluster dashboard, click **File Browser**.
2. Click your storage account name, click your container name (which is the same as your cluster name), and then click **user**.
3. Click **admin** and then click the GUID that has the last modified time (a little after the job start time you noted earlier). Copy this GUID. You will need it in the next section.


   	![The Hive query output file GUID listed in the File Browser tab.][img-hdi-dashboard-query-browse-output]


##<a name="powerquery"></a>Connect to Microsoft business intelligence tools for Excel

You can use the Power Query add-in for Microsoft Excel to import the job output from HDInsight into Excel, where Microsoft business intelligence tools can be used to further analyze the results.

You must have Excel 2013 or 2010 installed to complete this part of the tutorial.

**To download Microsoft Power Query for Excel**

- Download Microsoft Power Query for Microsoft Excel from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39379) and install it.

**To import HDInsight data**

1. Open Excel, and create a new workbook.
3. Click the **Power Query** menu, click **From Other Sources**, and then click **From Azure HDInsight**.

	![Excel PowerQuery Import menu open for Azure HDInsight.][image-hdi-gettingstarted-powerquery-importdata]

3. Enter the **Account Name** of the Azure Blob Storage account that is associated with your cluster, and then click **OK**. (This is the storage account you created earlier in the tutorial.)
4. Enter the **Account Key** for the Azure Blob Storage account, and then click **Save**.
5. In the right pane, double-click the blob name. By default the blob name is the same as the cluster name.

6. Locate **stdout** in the **Name** column. Verify that the GUID in the corresponding **Folder Path** column matches the GUID you copied earlier. A match suggests that the output data corresponds to the job you submitted. Click **Binary** in the column left of **stdout**.

	![Finding the data output by GUID in the list of content.][image-hdi-gettingstarted-powerquery-importdata2]

9. Click **Close & Load** in the upper-left corner to import the Hive job output into Excel.
