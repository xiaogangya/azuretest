#How to generate and transfer HSM-protected keys for Azure Key Vault

##Introduction

For added assurance, when you use Azure Key Vault, you can import or generate keys in hardware security modules (HSMs) that never leave the HSM boundary. This scenario is often referred to as *bring your own key*, or BYOK. The HSMs are FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated. Azure Key Vault uses Thales nShield family of HSMs to protect your keys.

Use the information in this topic to help you plan for, generate and then transfer your own HSM-protected keys to use with Azure Key Vault. 

>[AZURE.NOTE] For more information about Azure Key Vault, see [What is Azure Key Vault?](key-vault-whatis.md)  
>
>For a getting started tutorial, which includes creating a key vault for HSM-protected keys, see [Get started with Azure Key Vault](key-vault-get-started.md).

More information about generating and transferring an HSM-protected key over the Internet:

- You generate the key from an offline workstation, which reduces the attack surface.

- The key is encrypted with a Key Exchange Key (KEK), which stays encrypted until it is transferred to the Azure Key Vault HSMs. Only the encrypted version of your key leaves the original workstation.

- The toolset sets properties on your tenant key that binds your key to the Azure Key Vault security world. So after the Azure Key Vault HSMs receive and decrypt your key, only these HSMs can use it. Your key cannot be exported. This binding is enforced by the Thales HSMs.

- The Key Exchange Key (KEK) that is used to encrypt your key is generated inside the Azure Key Vault HSMs and is not exportable. The HSMs enforce that there can be no clear version of the KEK outside the HSMs. In addition, the toolset includes attestation from Thales that the KEK is not exportable and was generated inside a genuine HSM that was manufactured by Thales.

- The toolset includes attestation from Thales that the Azure Key Vault security world was also generated on a genuine HSM manufactured by Thales. This proves to you that Microsoft is using genuine hardware.

- Microsoft uses separate KEKs as well as separate Security Worlds in each geographical region, which ensures that your key can be used only in data centers in the region in which you encrypted it. For example, a key from a European customer cannot be used in data centers in North American or Asia.

##More information about Thales HSMs and Microsoft services

Thales e-Security is a leading global provider of data encryption and cyber security solutions to the financial services, high technology, manufacturing, government, and technology sectors. With a 40-year track record of protecting corporate and government information, Thales solutions are used by four of the five largest energy and aerospace companies, 22 NATO countries, and secure more than 80 per cent of worldwide payment transactions.

Microsoft has collaborated with Thales to enhance the state of art for HSMs. These enhancements enable you to get the typical benefits of hosted services without relinquishing control over your keys. Specifically, these enhancements let Microsoft manage the HSMs so that you do not have to. As a cloud service, Azure Key Vault scales up at short notice to meet your organization’s usage spikes. At the same time, your key is protected inside Microsoft’s HSMs: You retain control over the key lifecycle because you generate the key and transfer it to Microsoft’s HSMs.

##Implementing bring your own key (BYOK) for Azure Key Vault

Use the following information and procedures if you will generate your own HSM-protected key and then transfer it to Azure Key Vault—the bring your own key (BYOK) scenario.


##Prerequisites for BYOK

##Generate and transfer your key to Azure Key Vault HSM

You will use the following 5 steps to generate and transfer your key to an Azure Key Vault HSM: 

- [Step 1: Prepare your Internet-connected workstation](#step-1-prepare-your-internet-connected-workstation)
- [Step 2: Prepare your disconnected workstation](#step-2-prepare-your-disconnected-workstation)
- [Step 3: Generate your key](#step-3-generate-your-key)
- [Step 4: Prepare your key for transfer](#step-4-prepare-your-key-for-transfer)
- [Step 5: Transfer your key to Azure Key Vault](#step-5-transfer-your-key-to-azure-key-vault)

## Step 1: Prepare your Internet-connected workstation
For this first step, do the following procedures on your workstation that is connected to the Internet.


###Step 1.1: Install Azure PowerShell

From the Internet-connected workstation, download and install the Azure PowerShell module that includes the cmdlets to manage Azure Key Vault. This requires a minimum version of  0.8.13.

For installation instructions, see [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md).

###Step 1.2: Get your Azure subscription ID

Start an Azure PowerShell session and sign in to your Azure account by using the following command:

		Add-AzureAccount
In the pop-up browser window, enter your Azure account user name and password. Then, use the [Get-AzureSubscription](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn790366.aspx) command:

		Get-AzureSubscription
From the output, locate the ID for the subscription you will use for Azure Key Vault. You will need this subscription ID later.

Do not close the Azure PowerShell window.

###Step 1.3: Download the BYOK toolset for Azure Key Vault

Go to the Microsoft Download Center and [download the Azure Key Vault BYOK toolset](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=45345) for your region:

|Region|Package name|SHA-256 package hash|
|---|---|---|
|North America|KeyVault-BYOK-Tools-UnitedStates.zip|D9FDA9F5A34E1388CD6C9138E5B75B7051FB7D6B11F087AFE0553DC85CCF0E36|
|Europe|KeyVault-BYOK-Tools-Europe.zip|881DCA798305B8408C06BAE7B3EFBC1E9EA6113A8D6EC443464F3744896F32C3|
|Asia|KeyVault-BYOK-Tools-AsiaPacific.zip|0C76967B3AC76687E4EA47EB96174EE6B25AB24E3114E28A90D9B93A2E6ABF6E|
|Latin America|KeyVault-BYOK-Tools-LatinAmerica.zip|B38015990D4D1E522B8367FF78E78E0234BF9592663470426088C44C3CAAAF48|

To validate the integrity of your downloaded BYOK toolset, from your Azure PowerShell session, use the [Get-FileHash](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn520872.aspx) cmdlet.

	Get-FileHash KeyVault-BYOK-Tools-*.zip

The toolset includes the following:

- A Key Exchange Key (KEK) package that has a name beginning with **BYOK-KEK-pkg-.**
- A Security World package that has a name beginning with **BYOK-SecurityWorld-pkg-.**
- A python script named v**erifykeypackage.py.**
- A command-line executable file named **KeyTransferRemote.exe** and associated DLLs.
- A Visual C++ Redistributable Package, named **vcredist_x64.exe.**

Copy the package to a USB drive or other portable storage.

##Step 2: Prepare your disconnected workstation

For this second step, do the following procedures on the workstation that is not connected to a network (either the Internet or your internal network).


###Step 2.1: Prepare the disconnected workstation with Thales HSM

Install the nCipher (Thales) support software on a Windows computer, and then attach a Thales HSM to that computer. 

Ensure that the Thales tools are in your path (**%nfast_home%\bin** and **%nfast_home%\python\bin**). For example, type the following:

		set PATH=%PATH%;”%nfast_home%\bin”;”%nfast_home%\python\bin”

For more information, see the user guide included with the Thales HSM.

###Step 2.2: Install the BYOK toolset on the disconnected workstation

Copy the BYOK toolset package from the USB drive or other portable storage, and then do the following:

1. Extract the files from the downloaded package into any folder.
2. From that folder, run vcredist_x64.exe.
3. Follow the instructions to the install the Visual C++ runtime components for Visual Studio 2012.

##Step 3: Generate your key

For this third step, do the following procedures on the disconnected workstation.

###Step 3.1: Create a security world

Start a command prompt and run the Thales new-world program.

	new-world.exe --initialize --cipher-suite=DLf1024s160mRijndael --module=1 --acs-quorum=2/3

This program creates a **Security World** file at %NFAST_KMDATA%\local\world, which corresponds to the C:\ProgramData\nCipher\Key Management Data\local folder. You can use different values for the quorum but in our example, you’re prompted to enter three blank cards and pins for each one. Then, any two cards will give full access to the security world. These cards become the **Administrator Card Set** for the new security world. 

Then do the following:

- Back up the world file. Secure and protect the world file, the Administrator Cards, and their pins, and make sure that no single person has access to more than one card.

###Step 3.2: Validate the downloaded package

This step is optional but recommended so that you can validate the following:

- The Key Exchange Key that is included in the toolset has been generated from a genuine Thales HSM.
- The hash of the Security World that is included in the toolset has been generated in a genuine Thales HSM.
- The Key Exchange Key is non-exportable.

>[AZURE.NOTE]To validate the downloaded package, the HSM must be connected, powered on, and must have a security world on it (such as the one you’ve just created).

To validate the downloaded package:

1.	Run the verifykeypackage.py script by tying one of the following, depending on your region:
	- For North America:

			python verifykeypackage.py -k BYOK-KEK-pkg-NA-1 -w BYOK-SecurityWorld-pkg-NA-1
	- For Europe:

			python verifykeypackage.py -k BYOK-KEK-pkg-EU-1 -w BYOK-SecurityWorld-pkg-EU-1
	- For Asia:

			python verifykeypackage.py -k BYOK-KEK-pkg-AP-1 -w BYOK-SecurityWorld-pkg-AP-1
	- For Latin America:

			python verifykeypackage.py -k BYOK-KEK-pkg-LATAM-1 -w BYOK-SecurityWorld-pkg-LATAM-1
	- For Japan:

			python verifykeypackage.py -k BYOK-KEK-pkg-JPN-1 -w BYOK-SecurityWorld-pkg-JPN-1

	>[AZURE.TIP]The Thales software includes python at %NFAST_HOME%\python\bin
	
2.	Confirm that you see the following, which indicates successful validation: **Result: SUCCESS**

This script validates the signer chain up to the Thales root key. The hash of this root key is embedded in the script and its value should be **59178a47 de508c3f 291277ee 184f46c4 f1d9c639**. You can also confirm this value separately by visiting the [Thales website](http://www.thalesesec.com/).

You’re now ready to create a new key.

###Step 3.3: Create a new key

Generate a key by using the Thales **generatekey** program.

Run the following command to generate the key:

	generatekey --generate simple type=RSA size=2048 protect=module ident=contosokey plainname=contosokey nvram=no pubexp=

When you run this command, use these instructions:

- Replace the value of *contosokey* for the **ident** and **plainname** with any string value. To minimize administrative overheads and reduce the risk of errors, we recommend that you use the same value for both. The **ident** value must contain only numbers, dashes, and lower case letters.

- The pubexp is left blank (default) in this example, but you can specify specific values. For more information, see the Thales documentation.

This command creates a Tokenized Key file in your %NFAST_KMDATA%\local folder with a name starting with **key_simple_** followed by the ident that was specified in the command. For example: **key_simple_contosokey**. This file contains an encrypted key. 

Back up this Tokenized Key File in a safe location.

>[AZURE.IMPORTANT] When you later transfer your key to Azure Key Vault, Microsoft cannot export this key back to you so it becomes extremely important that you back up your key and security world safely. Contact Thales for guidance and best practices for backing up your key.

You are now ready to transfer your key to Azure Key Vault.

##Step 4: Prepare your key for transfer

For this fourth step, do the following procedures on the disconnected workstation.

###Step 4.1: Create a copy of your key with reduced permissions

To reduce the permissions on your key, from a command prompt, run one of the following, depending on your region:

- For North America:

		KeyTransferRemote.exe -ModifyAcls -KeyAppName simple -KeyIdentifier contosokey -ExchangeKeyPackage BYOK-KEK-pkg-NA-1 -NewSecurityWorldPackage BYOK-SecurityWorld-pkg-NA-1
- For Europe:

		KeyTransferRemote.exe -ModifyAcls -KeyAppName simple -KeyIdentifier contosokey -ExchangeKeyPackage BYOK-KEK-pkg-EU-1 -NewSecurityWorldPackage BYOK-SecurityWorld-pkg-EU-1
- For Asia:

		KeyTransferRemote.exe -ModifyAcls -KeyAppName simple -KeyIdentifier contosokey -ExchangeKeyPackage BYOK-KEK-pkg-AP-1 -NewSecurityWorldPackage BYOK-SecurityWorld-pkg-AP-1
- For Latin America:

		KeyTransferRemote.exe -ModifyAcls -KeyAppName simple -KeyIdentifier contosokey -ExchangeKeyPackage BYOK-KEK-pkg-LATAM-1 -NewSecurityWorldPackage BYOK-SecurityWorld-pkg-LATAM-1
- For Japan:

		KeyTransferRemote.exe -ModifyAcls -KeyAppName simple -KeyIdentifier contosokey -ExchangeKeyPackage BYOK-KEK-pkg-JPN-1 -NewSecurityWorldPackage BYOK-SecurityWorld-pkg-JPN-1

When you run this command, replace *contosokey* with the same value you specified in **Step 3.3: Create a new key** from the [Generate your key](#step-3-generate-your-key) step.

You will be asked to plug in your security world admin cards.

When the command completes, you will see **Result: SUCCESS** and the copy of your key with reduced permissions will be in the file named key_xferacId_<contosokey>.

###Step 4.2: Inspect the new copy of the key

Optionally, run the Thales utilities to confirm the minimal permissions on the new key:

- aclprint.py:

		"%nfast_home%\bin\preload.exe" -m 1 -A xferacld -K contosokey "%nfast_home%\python\bin\python" "%nfast_home%\python\examples\aclprint.py"
- kmfile-dump.exe:

		"%nfast_home%\bin\kmfile-dump.exe" "%NFAST_KMDATA%\local\key_xferacld_contosokey"
When you run these command, replace contosokey with the same value you specified in **Step 3.3: Create a new key** from the [Generate your key](#step-3-generate-your-key) step.

###Step 4.3: Encrypt your key by using Microsoft’s Key Exchange Key

Run one of the following commands, depending on your region:

- For North America:

		KeyTransferRemote.exe -Package -KeyIdentifier contosokey -ExchangeKeyPackage BYOK-KEK-pkg-NA-1 -NewSecurityWorldPackage BYOK-SecurityWorld-pkg-NA-1 -SubscriptionId SubscriptionID -KeyFriendlyName ContosoFirstHSMkey
- For Europe:

		KeyTransferRemote.exe -Package -KeyIdentifier contosokey -ExchangeKeyPackage BYOK-KEK-pkg-EU-1 -NewSecurityWorldPackage BYOK-SecurityWorld-pkg-EU-1 -SubscriptionId SubscriptionID -KeyFriendlyName ContosoFirstHSMkey
- For Asia:

		KeyTransferRemote.exe -Package -KeyIdentifier contosokey -ExchangeKeyPackage BYOK-KEK-pkg-AP-1 -NewSecurityWorldPackage BYOK-SecurityWorld-pkg-AP-1 -SubscriptionId SubscriptionID -KeyFriendlyName ContosoFirstHSMkey
- For Latin America:

		KeyTransferRemote.exe -Package -KeyIdentifier contosokey -ExchangeKeyPackage BYOK-KEK-pkg-LATAM-1 -NewSecurityWorldPackage BYOK-SecurityWorld-pkg-LATAM-1 -SubscriptionId SubscriptionID -KeyFriendlyName ContosoFirstHSMkey
- For Japan:

		KeyTransferRemote.exe -Package -KeyIdentifier contosokey -ExchangeKeyPackage BYOK-KEK-pkg-JPN-1 -NewSecurityWorldPackage BYOK-SecurityWorld-pkg-JPN-1 -SubscriptionId SubscriptionID -KeyFriendlyName ContosoFirstHSMkey

When you run this command, use these instructions:

- Replace *contosokey* with the identifier that you used to generate the key in **Step 3.3: Create a new key** from the [Generate your key](#step-3-generate-your-key) step.

- Replace *SubscriptionID* with the ID of the Azure subscription that contains your key vault. You retrieved this value previously, in **Step 1.2: Get your Azure subscription ID** from the [Prepare your Internet-connected workstation](#step-1-prepare-your-internet-connected-workstation) step.

- Replace *ContosoFirstHSMKey* with a label that will be used for your output file name.

When this completes successfully it displays **Result: SUCCESS** and there will be a new file in the current folder that has the following name: TransferPackage-*ContosoFirstHSMkey*.byok

###Step 4.4: Copy your key transfer package to the Internet-connected workstation 

Use a USB drive or other portable storage to copy the output file from the previous step (KeyTransferPackage-ContosoFirstHSMkey.byok) to your Internet-connected workstation.

##Step 5: Transfer your key to Azure Key Vault

For this final step, on the Internet-connected workstation, use the [Add-AzureKeyVaultKey](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn868048.aspx) cmdlet to upload the key transfer package that you copied from the disconnected workstation to the Azure Key Vault HSM:

	Add-AzureKeyVaultKey -VaultName 'ContosoKeyVaultHSM' -Name 'ContosoFirstHSMkey' -KeyFilePath 'c:\TransferPackage-ContosoFirstHSMkey.byok' -Destination 'HSM'

If the upload is successful, you see displayed the properties of the key that you just added.

##Next steps

You can now use this HSM-protected key in your key vault. For more information, see the **If you want to use a hardware security module (HSM)** section in the [Getting started with Azure Key Vault](key-vault-get-started.md) tutorial.
