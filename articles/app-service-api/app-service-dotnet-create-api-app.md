# Create an ASP.NET API app in Azure App Service

- [Visual Studio Code](app-service-create-aspnet-api-app-using-vscode.md)

## Overview

This tutorial shows how to create an ASP.NET Web API project that is configured for deployment to the cloud as an [API app in Azure App Service](app-service-api-apps-why-best-platform.md). For information about how to configure an existing Web API project for deployment as an API app, see [Configure a Web API project as an API app](app-service-dotnet-create-api-app-visual-studio.md).

Subsequent tutorials in the series show how to [deploy](app-service-dotnet-deploy-api-app.md) and [debug](../app-service-dotnet-remotely-debug-api-app.md) the API app project that you create in this tutorial.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [install-sdk-2015-2013](../../includes/install-sdk-2015-2013.md)]

This tutorial requires version 2.6 or later of the Azure SDK for .NET.

## Create an API app project

When the instructions direct you to enter a name for the project, enter **ContactsList**.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-api-create](../../includes/app-service-api-create.md)]

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-api-review-metadata](../../includes/app-service-api-review-metadata.md)]

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-api-define-api-app](../../includes/app-service-api-define-api-app.md)]

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-api-direct-deploy-metadata](../../includes/app-service-api-direct-deploy-metadata.md)]

## Next steps

Your API app is now ready to be deployed, and you can follow the [Deploy an API app](app-service-dotnet-deploy-api-app.md) tutorial to do that.
