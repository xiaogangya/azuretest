# Get started with the Wait Connector and add it to your Logic App
Wait connector enables an app to delay its execution for a specified duration or until the occurrence of a specified time. You can add the Wait Connector to your business workflow and process data as part of this workflow within a Logic App. When used in a Logic App, it can be used to delay execution.

## Using Wait Connector
To use the Wait connector, you need to first create an instance of the Wait Connector API app. This can be done either inline while creating a logic app or by selecting the Wait Connector API app from the Azure Marketplace.

## Using Wait Connector in the Logic Apps designer surface
Wait Connector can be used as an action. It does not have any triggers.

### Action
- Click on Wait Connector from the right pane:  
![List of Actions][1]
- Wait Connector supports two actions: 
	- Delay
	- Delay Until
	 
- Select *Delay*:  
![Delay input][2]
- Provide the inputs for the action and configure it:  
![Action configured][3]

Parameter|Type|Description of the parameter
---|---|---
Duration In Minutes|integer|Delay duration in minutes


## Do more with your Connector
Now that the connector is created, you can add it to a business flow using a Logic App. See [What are Logic Apps?](app-service-logic-what-are-logic-apps.md).

View the Swagger REST API reference at [Connectors and API Apps Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=529766).

You can also review performance statistics and control security to the connector. See [Manage  and Monitor API apps and connector](../app-service-api/app-service-api-manage-in-portal.md).
