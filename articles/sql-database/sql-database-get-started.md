# Create your first Azure SQL database

**Single database**

> [AZURE.SELECTOR]
- [Azure portal](sql-database-get-started.md)
- [C#](sql-database-get-started-csharp.md)
- [PowerShell](sql-database-get-started-powershell.md)

This article shows you how to create a sample SQL database in just a few minutes using the Azure portal. You'll learn how to:

- Create a server to host the database you create, and then set up a firewall rule for it
- Create a database from an AdventureWorks sample, which has data that you can play with

You'll need an Azure account and subscription before you start. If you don't have one, sign up for a [free trial](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Step 1: Sign in and start SQL database set up
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/).
2. Click **New** > **Data + Storage** > **SQL Database**.

	The **SQL Database** settings blade that appears is where you'll set up the server and database details.

## Step 2: Choose server settings
A SQL database in Azure lives on a database server. A server can host multiple databases. As you set up a database, you can also create and set up the server that will host it, or you can use one that was created earlier. We'll set up a new one.

1. Type a **Name** for your database (we use **AdventureWorks**). We'll come back to cover other database settings later.
2. Under **Server** click **Configure required settings**, and then click **Create a new server**.

	![Name your database](./media/sql-database-get-started/name-and-newserver.png)

3. In the **New server** blade, type a **Server Name** that's unique throughout Azure and easy to remember. You'll need this name later when you connect and work with your database.
4. Type a **Server admin login** that's easy to remember (we use **AdventureAdmin**). Then type a secure **Password** and type it again in **Confirm password**.

	![New database server settings](./media/sql-database-get-started/get-started-serversettings.png)

	 Leave **Create V12 Server (latest update)** set to **Yes** to use the latest features. The **Location** determines the data center region where your server is created.

	>[AZURE.TIP] Create database servers in a location close to  the applications that will use the database. If you want to change the location, just click **Location**, pick a different one, and then click **OK**.

5. Click **OK** to go back to **SQL Database** blade. 

The database and server aren't created yet. This happens after the next step, where you choose to create the database from the AdventureWorks sample and confirm settings.

## Step 4: Set up and create the database
1. In the **SQL Database** blade, click **Select source** and then click **Sample**. 

	![Create a database from a sample](./media/sql-database-get-started/new-sample-db.png)

2. You go back to the **SQL Database** blade, where **Select sample** now shows **AdventureWorks LT [V12]**. Click **Create** to kick off creation of the server and database.

	>[AZURE.NOTE] For this quick how-to, we didn't change the settings for **Pricing tier**, **Collation**, and **Resource group**. You can change the pricing tier of a database and scale up and down at any time, with no downtime. See [SQL Database Pricing](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/sql-database/) and [SQL database pricing tiers](sql-database-service-tiers.md) to learn more. The collation of a database can't be changed once you set it up here. See [Collation and Unicode Support](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms143726.aspx) for details about collation. See [Azure Resource Manager Overview](resource-group-overview.md) for details about Azure resource groups.

You jump back to the Azure Startboard, where a tile shows progress until the database is created and it's online. You can also click **Browse all** and then click **SQL Databases** to confirm the database is online.
	
Congratulations! You now have a database running in the cloud. You're almost finished. There's one key step left. You need to create a rule on the database server so you can connect to the database.

## Step 5: Configure the firewall

You need to set up a firewall rule on the server that allows connections from your client computer's IP address so you can work with the database. This not only helps make sure you can connect, it's a great way to see the area where you can get other details about your SQL servers in Azure. 

1. Click **Browse all**, scroll down and then click **SQL servers**, and then click the name of the server you created earlier from the list of **SQL servers**.

	![Select your database server](./media/sql-database-get-started/browse_dbservers.png)

	
3. In the database properties blade that appears to the right, click **Settings** and then click **Firewall** from the list.

	![Opening firewall settings](./media/sql-database-get-started/db_settings.png)


	The **Firewall settings** show your current **Client IP address**. 

	![Current IP address](./media/sql-database-get-started/firewall_config_client_ip.png)

4. Click **Add Client IP** to have Azure create a rule for that IP address, and then click **Save**.

	![Add the IP address](./media/sql-database-get-started/firewall_config_new_rule.png)

	>[AZURE.IMPORTANT] You're IP address is likely to change from time to time, and you may not be able to access your server until you create a new firewall rule. You can check your IP address using [Bing](http://www.bing.com/search?q=my%20ip%20address), and then add a single IP address or a range of IP addresses. See [How to configure firewall settings](sql-database-configure-firewall-settings.md) for details.
