[AZURE.INCLUDE [sql-database-develop-includes-selector-language-platform-depth](../../includes/sql-database-develop-includes-selector-language-platform-depth.md)]


This topic provides a C# code sample that demonstrates custom retry logic. The retry logic is designed to gracefully process temporary errors or *transient faults* that tend to go away if the program waits a few seconds and retries.


ADO.NET classes that you use to connect to your local Microsoft SQL Server can also connect to Azure SQL Database.
However, by themselves the ADO.NET classes cannot provide all the robustness and reliability necessary in production use.
Your client program can encounter transient faults from which it should silently and gracefully recover on its own. A couple examples of transient faults:


- A connection over the Internet is subject to brief network outages, after which the connection can be recreated.

- Cloud computing involves load balancing which can briefly block attempts to connect or query.


## Identify transient errors


Your program must distinguish between transient errors versus persistent errors.
If you program has a misspelling of the target database name, the "No such database found" error will persist and will reoccur every time you rerun the program.


The list of error numbers that are categorized as transient faults is available at:


- [Error messages for SQL Database client programs](sql-database-develop-error-messages.md#bkmk_connection_errors)
 - See the section about *Transient Errors, Connection-Loss Errors*.


## C# code sample


The C# code sample in the present topic contains custom detection and retry logic to handle transient errors.


The code sample follows a few basic guidelines or recommendations that apply regardless of which technology you use to interact with Azure SQL Database.
You can see the general recommendations at:


- [Connecting to SQL Database: Links, Best Practices and Design Guidelines](sql-database-connect-central-recommendations.md)


The C# code sample consists of the two .cs files whose content is pasted into the sections that follow.  Their file names are:


- `Program.cs`
- `Custom_SqlDatabaseTransientErrorDetectionStrategy.cs`


## Compile and run the code sample


You can compile the sample with the following steps:


1. In Visual Studio, create a new project from the C# Console Application template.

2. Right-click your project, and then add the .cs for which source code is provided in this topic.

3. In a `cmd.exe` command window, run the program as shown next. Actual output from a run is also shown.


		[C:\MyVS\ConsoleApplication1\ConsoleApplication1\bin\Debug\]
		>> ConsoleApplication1.exe
		database_firewall_rules_table   245575913
		filestream_tombstone_2073058421 2073058421
		filetable_updates_2105058535    2105058535
		
		[C:\MyVS\ConsoleApplication1\ConsoleApplication1\bin\Debug\]
		>>


The C# source code for the .cs files are in the following sections.


## Program.cs file


The demo program is designed so that:


- A transient fault during an attempt to connect leads to a retry.

- A transient error during a query command causes the program to discard the connection and create a new connection, before retrying the query command.


Microsoft neither recommends nor dis-recommends this design choice.
The demo program illustrates some of the design flexibility that is available to you.


### Length of the source code


The long length of the `Program.cs` file is due mostly to the logic that catches exceptions.


A [shorter version](#shorter_program_cs) of this `Program.cs` file is presented at the end in this topic, with all the retry logic and `Exception` handling removed.


### Call stack


The `Main` method is in `Program.cs`. The call stack runs as follows:


1. `Main` calls `ConnectAndQuery`.

2. `ConnectAndQuery` calls `EstablishConnection`.

3. `EstablishConnection` calls `IssueQueryCommand`.

## Custom_SqlDatabaseTransientErrorDetectionStrategy.cs code file


[`SqlDatabaseTransientErrorDetectionStrategy`](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.practices.enterpriselibrary.transientfaulthandling.sqldatabasetransienterrordetectionstrategy.aspx) is a class in the Enterprise Library (EntLib) API.
The present code sample uses the following custom class that borrows the idea of the EntLib class.

## Short version of Program.cs


The source code in this section is a shortened repeat of the longer `Program.cs` file presented earlier.
All the retry logic and all the exception handling has been removed.


The short version makes it easier to see the ADO.NET calls, knowing that these usually work.
Usually no transient faults occur and no exception is thrown.
And usually a skydiver does not need a backup parachute.
