# Connect to SQL Database by using PHP on Windows with Transient Fault Handling


[AZURE.INCLUDE [sql-database-develop-includes-selector-language-platform-depth](../../includes/sql-database-develop-includes-selector-language-platform-depth.md)]


This topic illustrates how you can connect to Azure SQL Database from a client application written in PHP that runs on Windows.


[AZURE.INCLUDE [sql-database-develop-includes-prerequisites-php-windows](../../includes/sql-database-develop-includes-prerequisites-php-windows.md)]


## Create a database and retrieve your connection string


See the [Getting Started Topic](sql-database-get-started.md) to learn how to create a sample database and retrieve your connection string. It is important you follow the guide to create an **AdventureWorks database template**. The samples shown below only work with the **AdventureWorks schema**. 


## Connect and query your database 

The demo program is designed so that a transient error during an attempt to connect leads to a retry. But a transient error during query command causes the program to discard the connection and create a new connection, before retrying the query command. We neither recommend nor disrecommend this design choice. The demo program illustrates some of the design flexibility that is available to you.

<br>The length of this code sample is due mostly to the catch exception logic. A shorter version of this Program.cs file is available this [here](sql-database-develop-php-simple-windows.md).
<br>The Main method is in Program.cs. The callstack runs as follows:
* Main calls ConnectAndQuery.
* ConnectAndQuery calls EstablishConnection.
* EstablishConnection calls IssueQueryCommand.

The [sqlsrv_query()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.sqlsrv-query.php) function can be used to retrieve a result set from a query against SQL Database. This function essentially accepts any query and the connection object and returns a result set which can be iterated over with the use of [sqlsrv_fetch_array()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.sqlsrv-fetch-array.php).
