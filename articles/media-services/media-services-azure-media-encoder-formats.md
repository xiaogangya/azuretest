##<a id="uncompressed"></a>Supported Uncompressed Video Formats 

Azure Media Services provides support for importing uncompressed video data.

This is a partial list of the supported uncompressed formats.

Uncompressed Video Format|Description
---|---
Standard YVU9 format uncompressed data|A planar YUV format. A Y sample at every pixel, a U and V sample at every fourth pixel horizontally on each line; a Y sample on every vertical line, a U and V sample at every fourth vertical line.9 bits per pixel.
YUV 411 format data|A Y sample at every pixel, a U and V sample at every fourth pixel horizontally on each line; every vertical line sampled. Byte ordering (lowest first) is U0, Y0, V0, Y1, U4, Y2, V4, Y3, Y4, Y5, Y6, Y7, where the suffix 0 is the leftmost pixel and increasing numbers are pixels increasing left to right. Each 12-byte block is 8 image pixels.
Y41P format data|A Y sample at every pixel, a U and V sample at every fourth pixel horizontally on each line; every vertical line sampled.Byte ordering (lowest first) is U0, Y0, V0, Y1, U4, Y2, V4, Y3, Y4, Y5, Y6, Y7, where the suffix 0 is the leftmost pixel and increasing numbers are pixels increasing left to right. Each 12-byte block is 8 image pixels.
YUY2 format data|Same as UYVY but with different pixel ordering. Byte ordering (lowest first) is Y0, U0, Y1, V0, Y2, U2, Y3, V2, Y4, U4, Y5, V4, where the suffix 0 is the leftmost pixel and increasing numbers are pixels increasing left to right. Each 4-byte block is 2 image pixels.
YVYU format data|A packed YUV format. Same as UYVY but with different pixel ordering. Byte ordering (lowest first) is Y0, V0, Y1, U0, Y2, V2, Y3, U2, Y4, V4, Y5, U4, where the suffix 0 is the leftmost pixel and increasing numbers are pixels increasing left to right. Each 4-byte block is 2 image pixels.
UYVY format data|A packed YUV format. A Y sample at every pixel, a U and V sample at every second pixel horizontally on each line; every vertical line sampled. Most popular of the various YUV 4:2:2 formats. Byte ordering (lowest first) is U0, Y0, V0, Y1, U2, Y2, V2, Y3, U4, Y4, V4, Y5, where the suffix 0 is the leftmost pixel and increasing numbers are pixels increasing left to right. Each 4-byte block is 2 image pixels.
YUV 211 format data|A packed YUV format. A Y sample at every second pixel, a U and V sample at every fourth pixel horizontally on each line; every vertical line sampled.Byte ordering (lowest first) is Y0, U0, Y2, V0, Y4, U4, Y6, V4, Y8, U8, Y10, V8, where the suffix 0 is the leftmost pixel and increasing numbers are pixels increasing left to right. Each 4-byte block is 4 image pixels.
Cirrus Logic Jr YUV 411 format|Cirrus Logic Jr YUV 411 format with less than 8 bits per Y, U, and V sample. A Y sample at every pixel, a U and V sample at every fourth pixel horizontally on each line; every vertical line sampled.
Indeo-produced YVU9 format|Indeo-produced YVU9 format with additional information about differences from the last frame. 9.5 bits per pixel but reported as 9.
