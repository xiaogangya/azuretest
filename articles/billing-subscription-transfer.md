# Transferring an Azure subscription

Do you:

- Need to hand over billing ownership of your Azure subscription to someone else?
- Want to change the account used to sign up for Azure? Perhaps you used your Microsoft Account but meant to use your work or school account instead?
- Want to move your Azure subscription from one directory to another?
- Have Azure and Office 365 in different tenants and want to consolidate?

If your account is in the US, you can now do this easily in the Microsoft Azure Account Center- for Pay-As-You-Go subscriptions.  We’ve added the ability to transfer your subscription to another user. In other words, you can now change the account admin on any Pay-As-You-Go subscription that you own.

## How to transfer an Azure subscription

1.  Sign in at <https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions>

2.  Select the subscription to transfer.

3.  Click the **Transfer Subscription** option.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

-   **Does a subscription transfer result in any service downtime?**

    There is no impact to the service. This effectively cancels the
    subscription under the current Account Administrator and creates a
    new one under the recipient’s account, but associates the underlying
    Azure services with the new subscription. The subscription ID
    remains the same.

-   **If I take over billing ownership of a subscription from another
    organization, will they continue to have access to my resources?**

    If the subscription is transferred to another tenant, the users associated with the previous tenant will lose access to the subscription. Even if a user is not a Service Admin or Co-admin anymore, they might still have access to the subscription through other security mechanisms. These include:
    - Management certificates that grant the user admin rights to subscription resources. For more information, see [Create and Upload a Management Certificate for Azure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/gg551722.aspx)
    -	Access keys for services like Storage. For more information, see [View, copy, and regenerate storage access keys](storage-create-storage-account.md#view-copy-and-regenerate-storage-access-keys)
    -	Remote Access credentials for services like Azure Virtual Machines

    This is not a complete list. The recipient should consider updating any secrets associated with the service if they need to restrict access to their resources. Most resources can be updated as follows:

    1.   Go to the Azure portal:   [*https://portal.azure.com*](https://portal.azure.com)

    2.    Click Browse All -&gt; All Resources

    3.    Select the resource. This opens the resource blade.

    4.    In the resource blade, click **Settings**. Here you can view and update existing secrets.


-   **If I transfer the subscription in the middle of the billing cycle,
    does the recipient pay for the entire billing cycle?**

    The sender is responsible for payment for any usage that was reported up to the point that the transfer is completed. The recipient is responsible for usage reported from the time of
    transfer onwards. There may be some usage that took place before transfer but was reported afterwards. This will be included in the recipient’s bill.

-   **Does the recipient have access to usage and billing history?**

    At this time, the only information revealed to the recipient is the amount of the last bill (or the current balance, if the subscription was transferred before the first bill was generated). The rest of the usage and billing history does not transfer with the subscription.

-   **Can the offer be changed during a transfer?**

    The offer must remain the same. To change your offer, you must [contact Support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=619338).

-   **Can I transfer a subscription to a user account in another
    country?**

    No, at this time this is not supported. The recipient’s user account must be in the same country.

-   **Can the recipient use a different payment mechanism?**

    Yes, and in fact you can use this mechanism to change the payment method on your subscription from invoice to credit card. Just transfer to another account you own, and enter your credit card while receiving the subscription. There are limitations here: now the subscription billing history is split across two accounts. But the advantage is that you can do this without having to [contact Support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=619338).
