#Injecting custom data into an Azure virtual machine

Injecting a script or other data into an Azure virtual machine when it is being provisioned is a very common scenario, regardless of whether the operating system is Windows or a Linux distribution. This topic describes how to:

- Inject data into an Azure virtual machine when it is being provisioned.

- Retrieve it for both Windows and Linux.

- Use special tools available on some systems to detect and handle custom data automatically.

> [AZURE.NOTE] This article describes how custom data can be injected by using a VM created with the Azure Service Management API. To see how to use the Azure Resource Management API, see [the example template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-vm-customdata).

## Injecting custom data into your Azure virtual machine

This feature is currently supported only in the [Azure Command-Line Interface](https://github.com/Azure/azure-xplat-cli). Although you may use any of the options for the `azure vm create` command, the following demonstrates one very basic approach.

```
    PASSWORD='AcceptablePassword -- more than 8 chars, a cap, a num, a special'
    VMNAME=mycustomdataubuntu
    USERNAME=username
    VMIMAGE= An image chosen from among those listed by azure vm image list
    azure vm create $VMNAME $VMIMAGE $USERNAME $PASSWORD --location "West US" --json -d ./custom-data.txt -e 22
```


## Using custom data in the virtual machine

+ If your Azure virtual machine is a Windows-based virtual machine, then the custom data file is saved to `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\AzureData\CustomData.bin`. Although it was base64-encoded to transfer from the local computer to the new virtual machine, it is automatically decoded and can be opened or used immediately.

   > [AZURE.NOTE] If the file exists, it is overwritten. The security on the directory is set to **System:Full Control** and **Administrators:Full Control**.

+ If your Azure virtual machine is a Linux-based virtual machine, then the custom data file will be located in the following two places. The data will be base64-encoded, so you will need to decode the data first.

    + At `/var/lib/waagent/ovf-env.xml`
    + At `/var/lib/waagent/CustomData`



## Cloud-init on Azure

If your Azure virtual machine is from an Ubuntu or CoreOS image, then you can use CustomData to send a cloud-config to cloud-init. Or if your custom data file is a script, then cloud-init can simply execute it.

### Ubuntu Cloud Images

In most Azure Linux images, you would edit "/etc/waagent.conf" to configure the temporary resource disk and swap file. See [Azure Linux Agent user guide](virtual-machines-linux-agent-user-guide.md) for more information.

However, on the Ubuntu Cloud Images, you must use cloud-init to configure the resource disk (that is, the "ephemeral" disk) and swap partition. See the following page on the Ubuntu wiki for more details: [AzureSwapPartitions](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AzureSwapPartitions).
