# Continuous delivery to Azure using Visual Studio Online and Git

You can use Visual Studio Online team projects to host a Git repository for your source code, and automatically build and deploy to Azure web apps or cloud services whenever you push a commit to the repository.

You'll need Visual Studio 2013 and the Azure SDK installed. If you don't already have Visual Studio 2013, download it by choosing the **Get started for free** link at [www.visualstudio.com](http://www.visualstudio.com). Install the Azure SDK from [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=239540).


> [AZURE.NOTE] You need an Visual Studio online account to complete this tutorial:
> You can [open a Visual Studio Online account for free](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=512979).

To set up a cloud service to automatically build and deploy to Azure by using Visual Studio Online, follow these steps.

## Step 1: Create a Git repository

1. If you donâ€™t already have a Visual Studio Online account, you can get one  [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=397665). When you create your team project, choose Git as your source control system. Follow the instructions to connect Visual Studio to your team project.

2. In **Team Explorer**, choose the **Clone this repository** link.

	![][3]

3. Specify the location of the local copy and then choose the **Clone** button.

## Step 2: Create a project and commit it to the repository

1. In **Team Explorer**, in the **Solutions** section, choose the **New** link to create a new project in the local repository.

	![][4]

2. You can deploy a web app or a cloud service (Azure Application) by following the steps in this walkthrough. Create a new Azure Cloud Service project,
or a new ASP.NET MVC project. Make sure that the project targets the .NET Framework 4 or later. If you are creating a cloud service project, add an ASP.NET MVC web role and a worker role.
If you want to create a web app, choose the **ASP.NET Web Application** project template, and then choose **MVC**. See [Create an ASP.NET web app in Azure App Service](../web-sites-dotnet-get-started.md) for more information.

3. Open the shortcut menu for the solution, and choose **Commit**.

	![][7]

4. If this is the first time you've used Git in Visual Studio Online, you'll need to provide some information to identify yourself in Git. In the **Pending Changes** area of **Team Explorer**, enter your username and email address. Enter a comment for the commit and then choose the **Commit** button.

	![][8]

5. Note the options to include or exclude specific changes when you check in. If the changes you want are excluded, choose **Include All**.

6. You've now committed the changes in your local copy of the repository. Next, sync those changes with the server by choosing the **Sync** link.

## Step 3: Connect the project to Azure

1. Now that you have a Git repository in Visual Studio Online with some source code in it, you are ready to connect your git repository to Azure.  In the [Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com), select your cloud service or web app, or create a new one by choosing the + icon at the bottom left and choosing **Cloud Service** or **Web App** and then **Quick Create**.

	![][9]

3. For cloud services, choose the **Set up publishing with Visual Studio Online** link. For web apps, choose the **Set up deployment from source control** link.

	![][10]

2. In the wizard, type the name of your Visual Studio Online account in the textbox and choose the **Authorize Now** link. You might be asked to sign in.

	![][11]

3. In the **Connection Request** pop-up dialog, choose **Accept** to authorize Azure to configure your team project in Visual Studio Online.

	![][12]

4. After authorization succeeds, you see a dropdown list that contains your Visual Studio Online team projects.  Select the name of team project that you created in the previous steps, and choose the wizard's checkmark button.

	![][13]

	The next time you push a commit to your repository, Visual Studio Online will build and deploy your project to Azure.

## Step 4: Trigger a rebuild and redeploy your project

1. In Visual Studio, open up a file and change it. For example, change the file `_Layout.cshtml` under the Views\\Shared folder in an MVC web role.

	![][17]

2. Edit the footer text for the site and save the file.

	![][18]

3. In **Solution Explorer**, open the shortcut menu for the solution node, project node, or the file you changed, and then choose **Commit**.

4. Type in a comment and choose **Commit**.

	![][20]

5. Choose the **Sync** link.

	![][38]

6. Choose the **Push** link to push your commit to the repository in Visual Studio Online. (You can also use the **Sync** button to copy your commits to the repository. The difference is that **Sync** also pulls the latest changes from the repository.)

	![][39]

7. Choose the **Home** button to return to the **Team Explorer** home page.

	![][21]

8. Choose **Builds** to view the builds in progress.

	![][22]

	**Team Explorer** shows that a build has been triggered for your check-in.

	![][23]

9. To view a detailed log as the build progresses, double-click the name of the build in progress.

10. While the build is in-progress, take a look at the build definition that was created when you used the wizard to link to Azure.  Open the shortcut menu for the build definition and choose **Edit Build Definition**.

	![][25]

11. In the **Trigger** tab, you will see that the build definition is set to build on every check-in, by default. (For a cloud service, Visual Studio Online builds and deploys the master branch to the staging environment automatically. You still have to do a manual step to deploy to the live site. For a web app that doesn't have staging environment, it deploys the master branch directly to the live site.

	![][26]

1. In the **Process** tab, you can see the deployment environment is set to the name of your cloud service or web app.

	![][27]

1. Specify values for the properties if you want different values than the defaults. The properties for Azure publishing are in the **Deployment** section, and you might also need to set MSBuild parameters. For example, in a cloud service project, to specify a service configuration other than "Cloud", set the MSbuild parameters to `/p:TargetProfile=[YourProfile]` where *[YourProfile]* matches a service configuration file with a name like ServiceConfiguration.*YourProfile*.cscfg.

	The following table shows the available properties in the **Deployment** section:

	|Property|Default Value|
	|---|---|
	|Allow Untrusted Certificates|If false, SSL certificates must be signed by a root authority.|
	|Allow Upgrade|Allows the deployment to update an existing deployment instead of creating a new one. Preserves the IP address.|
	|Do Not Delete|If true, do not overwrite an existing unrelated deployment (upgrade is allowed).|
	|Path to Deployment Settings|The path to your .pubxml file for a web app, relative to the root folder of the repo. Ignored for cloud services.|
	|Sharepoint Deployment Environment|The same as the service name.|
	|Azure Deployment Environment|The web app or cloud service name.|

1. By this time, your build should be completed successfully.

	![][28]

1. If you double-click the build name, Visual Studio shows a **Build Summary**, including any test results from associated unit test projects.

	![][29]

1. In the [Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com), you can view the associated deployment on the **Deployments** tab when the staging environment is selected.

	![][30]

1.	Browse to your site's URL. For a web app, just choose  the **Browse** button in the portal. For a cloud service, choose the URL in the **Quick Glance** section of the **Dashboard** page that shows the Staging environment.

	Deployments from continuous integration for cloud services are published to the Staging environment by default. You can change this by setting the **Alternate Cloud Service Environment** property to **Production**. Here's where the site URL is on the cloud service's dashboard page.

	![][31]

	A new browser tab will open to reveal your running site.

	![][32]

1.	If you make other changes to your project, you trigger more builds, and you will accumulate multiple deployments. The latest one is marked as Active.

	![][33]

## Step 5: Redeploy an earlier build

This step is optional. In the Azure management portal, choose an earlier deployment and choose **Redeploy** to rewind your site to an earlier check-in. Note that this will trigger a new build in TFS and create a new entry in your deployment history.

![][34]

## Step 6: Change the Production deployment

When you are ready, you can promote the Staging environment to the Production environment by choosing **Swap** in the Azure management portal. The newly deployed Staging environment is promoted to Production, and the previous Production environment, if any, becomes a Staging environment. The Active deployment may be different for the Production and Staging environments, but the deployment history of recent builds is the same regardless of environment.

![][35]

## Step 6: Deploy from a working branch.

When you use Git, you usually make changes in a working branch and integrate into the master branch when your development reaches a finished state. During the development phase of a project, you'll want to build and deploy the working branch to Azure.

1. In **Team Explorer**, choose the **Home** button and then choose the **Branches** button.

	![][40]

2. Choose the **New Branch** link.

	![][41]

3. Enter the name of the branch, such as "working," and choose **Create Branch**. This creates a new local branch.

	![][42]

4. Publish the branch. Choose the branch name in **Unpublished branches**, and choose **Publish**.

	![][44]

6. By default, only changes to the master branch trigger a continuous build. To set up continuous build for a working branch, choose the **Builds** page in **Team Explorer**, and choose **Edit Build Definition**.

7. Open the **Source Settings** tab. Under **Monitored branches for continuous integration and build**, choose **Click here to add a new row**.

	![][47]

8. Specify the branch you created, such as refs/heads/working.

	![][48]

9. Make a change in the code, open the shortcut menu for the changed file, and then choose **Commit**.

	![][43]

10. Choose the **Unsynced Commits** link, and choose  the **Sync** button or the **Push** link to copy the changes to the copy of the working branch in Visual Studio Online.

	![][45]

11. Navigate to the **Builds** view and find the build that just got triggered for the working branch.
