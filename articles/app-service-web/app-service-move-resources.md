# Supported Move Configurations

You can move Azure Web App resources using the [ARM Move Resources Api](../resource-group-move-resources.md).

Azure Web Apps currently supports the following move scenarios:

* Moving the entire contents of a resource group (web apps, app service plans, and certificates) to another resource group 
	* Note: The destination resource group can not contain any Microsoft.Web resources in this scenario
* Moving individual web apps to a different resource group, while still hosting them in their current app service plan (the app service plan stays in the old resource group)
