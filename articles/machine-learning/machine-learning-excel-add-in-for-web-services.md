# Excel Add-in for Azure Machine Learning web services

Excel makes it easy to call web services directly without the need to write any code.

## Steps to Use an Existing Web Service in the Workbook

1. Open the [sample Excel file](http://aka.ms/amlexcel-sample-2), which contains the Excel add-in and data about passengers on the Titanic.
2. Choose the web service by clicking it - "Titanic Survivor Predictor (Excel Add-in Sample) [Score]" in this example.

    ![Select web service][01]

3. This will take you to the **Predict** section.  This workbook already contains sample data, but for a blank workbook you may also select a cell in Excel and click **Use sample data**.
4. Select the data with headers and click the input data range icon.  Make sure the "My data has headers" box is checked.
5. Under **Output**, enter the cell number where you want the output to be, e.g. "H1" here.
6. Click **Predict**.

## Steps to Add a New Web Service

1. Publish a web service ([this page](machine-learning-walkthrough-5-publish-web-service.md) explains how to do it) or use an existing web service.
2. In Excel, go to the **Web Services** section (if you are in the **Predict** section, click the back arrow to go to the list of web services).

3. Click **Add Web Service**.
4. In Machine Learning Studio, click the **WEB SERVICES** section in the left pane, and then select the web service.

5. Copy the API key for the web service.

6. Paste the API key into the Excel add-in text box labeled **API key**.
7. On the **DASHBOARD** tab for the web service, click the **REQUEST/RESPONSE** link.
8. Look for the **OData Endpoint Address** section.  Copy the URL and paste that into the text box labeled **URL**.
9. Click **Add**.

10.	To use the web service, follow the directions above, "Steps to Use an Existing Web Service".

## Sharing Your Workbook

If you save your workbook, then the API keys for the web services you have added will also be saved.  That means you should only share the workbook with individuals you trust.
