## Overview of Password Management reports
Once you deploy password reset, one of the most common next steps is to see how it is being used in your organization.  For example, you may want to get insight into how users are registering for password reset, or how many password resets have been done in the last few days.  Here are some of the common questions that you will be able to answer with the Password Management reports that exist in the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com) today:

- How many people have registered for password reset?
- Who has registered for password reset?
- What data are people registering?
- How many people reset their passwords in the last 7 days?
- What are the most common methods users or admins use to reset their passwords?
- What are common issues users or admins face when attempting to use password reset?
- What admins are resetting their own passwords frequently?
- Is there any suspicious activity going on with password reset?
