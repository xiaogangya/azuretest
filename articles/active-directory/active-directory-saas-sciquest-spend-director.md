# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with SciQuest Spend Director

The objective of this tutorial is to show you how to integrate SciQuest Spend Director with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).<br>Integrating SciQuest Spend Director with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits: 

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to SciQuest Spend Director 
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to SciQuest Spend Director (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure Active Directory Portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis.md).

## Prerequisites 

To configure Azure AD integration with SciQuest Spend Director, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A SciQuest Spend Director single-sign on enabled subscription


> [AZURE.NOTE] To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.


To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- You should not use your production environment, unless this is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/). 

 
## Scenario Description
The objective of this tutorial is to enable you to test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. <br>
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding SciQuest Spend Director from the gallery 
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on


## Adding SciQuest Spend Director from the gallery
To configure the integration of SciQuest Spend Director into Azure AD, you need to add SciQuest Spend Director from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add SciQuest Spend Director from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **Azure Management Portal**, on the left navigation pane, click **Active Directory**. <br><br>
![Active Directory][1]

2. From the **Directory** list, select the directory for which you want to enable directory integration.

3. To open the applications view, in the directory view, click **Applications** in the top menu.<br><br>
![Applications][2]
4. Click **Add** at the bottom of the page.<br><br>
![Applications][3]
5. On the **What do you want to do** dialog, click **Add an application from the gallery**.<br><br>
![Applications][4]
6. In the search box, type **sciQuest spend director**.<br>
![Applications][5]
7. In the results pane, select **SciQuest Spend Director**, and then click **Complete** to add the application.<br>
![Applications][6]


##  Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
The objective of this section is to show you how to configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SciQuest Spend Director based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in SciQuest Spend Director to an user in Azure AD is. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in SciQuest Spend Director needs to be established.<br>
This link relationship is established by assigning the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** in SciQuest Spend Director.
 
To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SciQuest Spend Director, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Creating a SciQuest Spend Director test user](#creating-a-halogen-software-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in SciQuest Spend Director that is linked to the Azure AD representation of her.
5. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD Single Single Sign-On

### Creating a SciQuest Spend Director test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called Britta Simon in SciQuest Spend Director.

You need to contact your SciQuest Spend Director support team and provide them with the details about your test account to get it created.

Alternatively, you can also leverage just-in-time provisioning, a single sign-on feature that is supported by SciQuest Spend Director. <br>
If just-in-time provisioning is enabled, users are automatically created by SciQuest Spend Director during a single sign-on attempt if they don't exist. This feature eliminates the need to manually create single sign-on counterpart users.

To get just-in-time provisioning enabled, you need to contact your your SciQuest Spend Director support team.
  

### Assigning the Azure AD test user
