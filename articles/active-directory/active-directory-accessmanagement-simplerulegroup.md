# Creating a simple rule to configure dynamic memberships for a group

**To enable dynamic membership for a particular group, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure Management Portal, under the **Groups** tab, select the group you want to edit, and then in this groupâ€™s **Configure** tab, set the **Enable Dynamic Memberships** switch to **Yes**.


2. You can now set up a simple single rule for the group that will control how dynamic membership for this group functions. Make sure the **Add users where** radio button is selected and then select a user property from the pull-down menu (for example, department, jobTitle, etc.), 

3. Next, select a condition (Not Equals, Equals, Not Starts With, Starts With, Not Contains, Contains, Not Match, Match), and finally specify a value for the selected user property. For example, if a group is assigned to a SaaS application and you enable dynamic memberships for this group by setting a rule whereby **Add users where** is set to the jobTitle that Equals(-eq)Sales Rep, all users within your Azure AD directory whose job titles are set to Sales Rep, will have access to this SaaS application.
