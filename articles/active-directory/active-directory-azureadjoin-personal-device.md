# Join a personal device to your organization

To join a Windows 10 device to your organization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.	From the **Start** menu, select **Settings**.
2.	Select **Accounts**, and then click **Your account**.
3.	Click **Add Work or School account**, and then type in your organizational account.
4.	You will then be taken to the sign-in page for your organization. Enter your username and password and click **OK**.
5.	You will then be prompted for a multi-factor authentication challenge. This is configurable by IT.
6.	Azure AD will then check whether this user/device requires mobile device management (MDM) enrollment.
7.	Windows will then register the device in the organizationâ€™s directory in Azure AD and enroll it in MDM.
8.	When this is done, if you are a managed user, Windows will wrap up the setup process and take the user to the desktop through the automatic sign-in screen.
9.	If you are a federated user, you will be taken to the Windows sign-in screen and have to enter your credentials.
