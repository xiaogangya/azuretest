#Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Workday
>[AZURE.TIP]For feedback, click [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=330042).
  
The objective of this tutorial is to show the integration of Azure and Workday. The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following items:

-   A valid Azure subscription
-   A tenant in Workday
  
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of the following building blocks:

1.  Enabling the application integration for Workday
2.  Configuring single sign-on
3.  Configuring user provisioning
4.  Configuring user provisioning

##Enabling the application integration for Workday
  
The objective of this section is to outline how to enable the application integration for Salesforce.

###To enable the application integration for Workday, perform the following steps:

1.  In the Azure Management Portal, on the left navigation pane, click **Active Directory**.

    ![Active Directory](./media/active-directory-saas-workday-tutorial/IC700993.png "Active Directory")

2.  From the **Directory** list, select the directory for which you want to enable directory integration.

3.  To open the applications view, in the directory view, click **Applications** in the top menu.

##Configuring single sign-on
  
The objective of this section is to outline how to enable users to authenticate to Workday with their account in Azure AD using federation based on the SAML protocol.  
As part of this procedure, you are required to create a base-64 encoded certificate.  
If you are not familiar with this procedure, see [How to convert a binary certificate into a text file](http://youtu.be/PlgrzUZ-Y1o).

###To configure single sign-on, perform the following steps:

1.  On the **Workday** application integration page, click **Configure single sign-on** to open the **Configure Single Sign On ** dialog.
