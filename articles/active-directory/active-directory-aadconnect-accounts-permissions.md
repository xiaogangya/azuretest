# Accounts and permissions required for Azure AD Connect

The Azure AD Connect installation wizard offers two different paths:

- In Express Settings, we require more privileges so that we can setup your configuration easily, without requiring you to create users or configure permissions separately.

- In Custom Settings we offer you more choices and options, but there are some situations in which youâ€™ll need to ensure you have the correct permissions yourself.

| Upgrade from DirSync | [Upgrade from Azure AD sync tool (DirSync)](active-directory-aadconnect-dirsync-upgrade-get-started.md) |


## Express settings installation
In Express settings the installation wizard will ask for Enterprise Admin credentials so your on-premises Active Directory can be configured with required permissions for Azure AD Connect. If you are upgrading from DirSync the Enterprise Admins credentials are used to reset the password for the account used by DirSync.

Wizard Page  | Credentials Collected | Permissions Required| Used For
------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |
N/A|User running the installation wizard| Administrator of the local server| <li>Creates the local account that will be used as the [sync engine service account](#azure-ad-connect-sync-service-account).
Connect to Azure AD| Azure AD directory credentials | Global administrator role in Azure AD | <li>Enabling sync in the Azure AD directory.</li>  <li>Creation of the [Azure AD account](#azure-ad-service-account) that will be used for on-going sync operations in Azure AD.</li>

This created account is used to read and write directory information during synchronization.</li>

### Enterprise Admin credentials
These credentials are only used during the installation and will not be used after the installation has completed. It is Enterprise Admin, and not Domain Admin, to make sure the permissions in Active Directory can be set in all domains.

### Global Admin credentials
These credentials are only used during the installation and will not be used after the installation has completed. It is used to create the [Azure AD account](#azure-ad-service-account) used for synchronizing changes to Azure AD. The account will also enable sync as a feature in Azure AD. The account used cannot have MFA enabled.

## Custom settings installation
When using custom settings the account used to connect to Active Directory must be created before the installation.

### Create the AD DS account
When you install Azure AD Connect the account you specify on the **Connect your directories** page must be present in Active Directory and have required permissions granted. The installation wizard will not verify the permissions and any issues will only be found during synchronization.

Which permissions you require depends on the optional features you enable. If you have multiple domains, the permissions must be granted for all domains in the forest. If you do not enable any of these features the default **Domain User** permissions will be sufficient.

| Feature | Permissions |
| ------ | ------ |
| Password sync | <li>Replicate Directory Changes</li>  <li>Replicate Directory Changes All |
| Exchange hybrid deployment | Write permissions to the attributes documented in [Exchange hybrid writeback](active-directory-aadconnectsync-attributes-synchronized.md#exchange-hybrid-writeback) for users, groups, and contacts. |
| Password writeback | Write permissions to the attributes documented in [Getting started with password management](active-directory-passwords-getting-started.md#step-4-set-up-the-appropriate-active-directory-permissions) for users. |
| Device writeback | Permissions granted with a PowerShell script as described in [device writeback](active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom-device-writeback.md).|
| Group writeback | Read, Create, Update, and Delete group objects in the OU where the distributions groups should be located.|

## Upgrade
When you upgrade from one version of Azure AD Connect to a new release, you will need the following permissions:

| Principal | Permissions required | Used for |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| User running the installation wizard | Administrator of the local server | Update binaries. |
| User running the installation wizard | Member of ADSyncAdmins | Make changes to Sync Rules and other configuration. |
| User running the installation wizard | If using a full SQL server: DBO (or similar) of the sync engine database | Make database level changes, such as updating tables with new columns. |

## More about the created accounts

### Active Directory account

If you use express settings, then an account will be created in Active Directory which will be used for synchronization. The created account will be located in the forest root domain in the Users container and will have its name prefixed with **MSOL_**. The account is created with a long complex password which does not expire. If you have a password policy in your domain, make sure long and complex passwords would be allowed for this account.

### Azure AD Connect sync service accounts
Two local service accounts are created by the installation wizard (unless you specify the account to use in custom settings). The account prefixed **AAD_** is used for the actual sync service to run as. If you install Azure AD Connect on a Domain Controller, the accounts are created in the domain. If you use a SQL server on a remote server, the **AAD_** service account must be located in the domain. The account prefixed **AADSyncSched_** is used for the scheduled task which is running the sync engine.

![Sync Service Account](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-accounts-permissions/syncserviceaccount.png)

The accounts are created with a long complex password which does not expire.

For the sync engine service account, this account will be used by Windows to store the encryption keys so the password for this account should not be reset or changed.

If you use a full SQL Server then the service account will be the DBO of the created database for the sync engine. The service will not function as intended with any other permissions. A SQL login will also be created.

The account is also granted permissions to files, registry keys, and other objects related to the Sync Engine.

### Azure AD service account
An account in Azure AD will be created for the sync service's use. This account can be identified with its display name.

![AD account](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-accounts-permissions/aadsyncserviceaccount.png)

The name of the server the account is used on can be identified in the second part of the user name. In the picture above the server name is FABRIKAMCON. If you have staging servers, each server will have its own account. There is a limit of 10 sync service accounts in Azure AD.

The service account is created with a long complex password which does not expire. It is granted a special role **Directory Synchronization Accounts** which has only permissions to perform directory synchronization tasks. This special built-in role cannot be granted outside the Azure AD Connect wizard and the Azure portal will only show this account with the role **User**.
