# Azure AD Connect Health Agent Installation for AD FS

This document will walk you through installing and configuring the Azure AD Connect Health Agent for AD FS on your servers. 

>[AZURE.NOTE]Remember that before you see any data in your instance of Azure AD Connect Health, you will need to install the Azure AD Connect Health Agent on your targeted servers.  Be sure to complete the requirements [here](active-directory-aadconnect-health.md#requirements) prior to installing the agent.  You can download the agent [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=518973).


## Agent installation
To start the agent installation, double-click on the .exe file that you downloaded. On the first screen, click Install.

This will launch a command prompt followed by some PowerShell that will execute Register-AzureADConnectHealthADFSAgent. You will be prompted to sign in to Azure. Go ahead and sign in.

After signing in, PowerShell will continue. Once it completes you can close PowerShell and the configuration is complete.

At this point, the services should be started automatically and the agent will be now monitoring and gathering data.  Be aware that you will see warnings in the PowerShell window if you have not met all of the pre-requisites that were outlined in the previous sections. Be sure to complete the requirements [here](active-directory-aadconnect-health.md#requirements) prior to installing the agent. The following screenshot below is an example of these errors.

To verify the agent has been installed, open services and look for the following. These services should be running if you completed the configuration. Otherwise, they will not start until the configuration is complete.

- Azure AD Connect Health AD FS Diagnostics Service
- Azure AD Connect Health AD FS Insights Service
- Azure AD Connect Health AD FS Monitoring Service
