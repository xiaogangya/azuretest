# Irregular sign in activity

Irregular Sign ins are those that have been identified by our machine learning algorithms, on the basis of an "impossible travel" condition combined with an anomalous sign in location and device. This may indicate that a hacker has successfully signed in using this account.
We will send an email notification to the global admins if we encounter 10 or more anomalous sign in events within a span of 30 days or less. Please be sure to include aad-alerts-noreply@mail.windowsazure.com in your safe senders list.
