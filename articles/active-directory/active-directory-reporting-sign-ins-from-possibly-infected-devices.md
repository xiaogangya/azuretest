# Sign ins from possibly infected devices
<p>This report attempts to identify your users' devices that that have become infected and are now part of a botnet (also known as a zombie army). We correlate IP addresses of users' sign ins against IP addresses that we know to be in contact with botnet servers.</p>
<p>Recommendation: This report flags IP addresses, not user devices. We recommend that you contact the user and scan all the user's devices to be certain. It is also possible that a user's personal device is infected, or that someone other than the user, who was using the same IP address as the user, has an infected device. </p>
<p>For more information about how to address malware infections, see the [Malware Protection Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=335773). </p>
