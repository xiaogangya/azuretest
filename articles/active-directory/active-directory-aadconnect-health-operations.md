# Azure AD Connect Health Operations

The following topic describes the various operations that can be performed using Azure AD Connect Health.

## Enable Email Notifications
You can configure the Azure AD Connect Health Service to send email notifications when alerts are generated indicating your Federation Service Infrastructure is not healthy.

Please note that by default email notifications are disabled. 


### To enable Azure AD Connect Health Email Notifications

2. Click on the "Notification Settings" button from the action bar.
3. Turn the Email Notification switch to ON.
4. Select the check box to configure all the Global Tenant Admins to receive email notifications.
5. If you wish to receive email notifications on any other email addresses, you can specify them in the Additional Email Recipients boxes. To remove an email address from this list, right click on the entry and select Delete.
6. To finalize the changes click on "Save". All changes will take effects only after you select "Save".

- This action will NOT delete the data already collected from this server. That data will be deleted as per the Microsoft Azure Data Retention Policy.
