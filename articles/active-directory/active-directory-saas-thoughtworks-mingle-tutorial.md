The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of the following building blocks:

1.  Enabling the application integration for Thoughtworks Mingle
2.  Configuring single sign-on
3.  Configuring user provisioning
4.  Assigning users

##Configuring user provisioning
  
For AAD users to be able to sign in, they must be provisioned to the Thoughtworks Mingle application using their Azure Active Directory user names.  
In the case of Thoughtworks Mingle, provisioning is a manual task.

###To configure user provisioning, perform the following steps:

1.  Log in to your Thoughtworks Mingle company site as administrator.

2.  Click **Profile**.

    ![Your First Project](./media/active-directory-saas-thoughtworks-mingle-tutorial/IC785160.png "Your First Project")

3.  Click the **Admin** tab, and then click **Users**.

    ![Users](./media/active-directory-saas-thoughtworks-mingle-tutorial/IC785161.png "Users")

4.  Click **New User**.

    ![New User](./media/active-directory-saas-thoughtworks-mingle-tutorial/IC785162.png "New User")

5.  On the **New User** dialog page, perform the following steps:

    ![New User](./media/active-directory-saas-thoughtworks-mingle-tutorial/IC785163.png "New User")

    1.  Type the **Sign-in name**, **Display name**, **Choose password**, **Confirm password** of a valid AAD account you want to provision into the related textboxes.
    2.  As **User type**, select **Full user**.
    3.  Click **Create This Profile**.

>[AZURE.NOTE] You can use any other Thoughtworks Mingle user account creation tools or APIs provided by Thoughtworks Mingle to provision AAD user accounts.

##Assigning users
  
To test your configuration, you need to grant the Azure AD users you want to allow using your application access to it by assigning them.

###To assign users to Thoughtworks Mingle, perform the following steps:

1.  In the Azure AD portal, create a test account.

2.  On the **Thoughtworks Mingle** application integration page, click **Assign users**.

    ![Assign Users](./media/active-directory-saas-thoughtworks-mingle-tutorial/IC785164.png "Assign Users")
