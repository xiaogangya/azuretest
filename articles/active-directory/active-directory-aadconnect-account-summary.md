# More about Azure AD Connect credentials and permissions 1


The Azure AD Connect wizard offers two different paths with distinct permissions requirements:  

* In Express Settings, we require more privileges so that we can setup your configuration easily, without requiring you to create users or configure permissions separately. 

* In Custom Settings we offer you more choices and options, but there are some situations in which you’ll need to ensure you have the correct permissions yourself. 


## Credentials that are collected and what they are used for in an Express setup

Wizard Page  | Credentials Collected | Permissions Required| Used For 
------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |
Connect to Azure AD| Azure AD directory credentials | Global administrator role in Azure AD | <li>Enabling sync in the Azure AD directory.</li>  <li>Creation of the Azure AD account that will be used for on-going sync operations in Azure AD.</li>
Connect to AD DS | On-premises Active Directory credentials | Member of the Enterprise Admins (EA) group in Active Directory|  Used as the local AD Connector account, that is, it is the account that reads and writes the directory information for synchronization.
NA|Logon credentials of the user running the wizard| Administrator of the local server|The wizard creates the AD account that will be used as the sync service logon account on the local machine.
