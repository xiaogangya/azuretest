If you've tried the troubleshooting steps below and are still running into problems, you can post a question on the [Azure AD Forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/azure/home?forum=WindowsAzureAD) or contact support and we'll take a look at your problem as soon as we can.

## Information to include when you need help

If you cannot solve your issue with the guidance below, you can contact our support engineers. When you contact them, it is recommended to include the following information:

 - **General description of the error** – what exact error message did the user see?  If there was no error message, describe the unexpected behavior you noticed, in detail.
 - **Page** – what page were you on when you saw the error (include the URL)?
 - **Date / Time / Timezone** – what was the precise date and time you saw the error (include the timezone)?
 - **Support Code** – what was the support code generated when the user saw the error (to find this, reproduce the error, then click the Support Code link at the bottom of the screen and send the support engineer the GUID that results). 
   - If you are on a page without a support code at the bottom, press F12 and search for SID and CID and send those two results to the support engineer.

    ![][001]

 - **User ID** – what was the ID of the user who saw the error (e.g. user@contoso.com)?
 - **Information about the user** – was the user federated, password hash synced, cloud only?  Did the user have an AAD Premium or AAD Basic license assigned?
 - **Application Event Log** – if you are using Password Writeback and the error is in your on-premises infrastructure, please zip up a copy of your application event log from your Azure AD Connect server and send along with your request.

Including this information will help us to solve your problem as quickly as possible.

## Troubleshoot Password Writeback
If you encounter an error when enabling, disabling, or using Password Writeback, you might be able to resolve it by following the troubleshooting steps below:

            </td>
            <td>
              <p>When Password Writeback is enabled, the sync engine will call the writeback library to perform the configuration (onboarding) by talking to the cloud onboarding service. Any errors encountered during onboarding or while starting the WCF endpoint for Password Writeback will result in errors in the Event log in your Azure AD Connect machine’s event log.</p>
              <p>During restart of ADSync service, if writeback was configured, the WCF endpoint will be started up. However, if the startup of the endpoint fails, we will simply log event 6800 and let the sync service startup. Presence of this event means that the Password Writeback endpoint was not started up. Event log details for this event (6800) along with event log entries generate by PasswordResetService component will indicate why the endpoint could not be started up. Review these event log errors and try to re-start the Azure AD Connect if Password Writeback still isn’t working. If the problem persists, try to disable and re-enable Password Writeback.</p>

              <ol class="ordered">
                <li>
										You configure Azure AD Connect for tenant abc.com (Verified domain) using creds . This results in AAD connector with name “abc.com – AAD” being created.<br\><br\></li>
                <li>
										You then then change the AAD creds for the connector (using old sync UI) to  (note it’s the same tenant but different domain name). <br\><br\></li>
                <li>
										Now you try to enable/disable Password Writeback. The wizard will construct the name of the connector using the creds, as “abc.onmicrosoft.com – AAD” and pass to the Password Writeback cmdlet. This will fail because there is no connector created with this name.<br\><br\></li>
              </ol>
              <p>This has been fixed in our latest builds. If you have an older build, the one workaround is to use the powershell cmdlet to enable/disable the feature.

## Password Writeback event log error codes
A best practice when troubleshooting issues with Password Writeback is to inspect that Application Event Log on your Azure AD Connect machine. This event log will contain events from two sources of interest for Password Writeback. The PasswordResetService source will describe operations and issues related to the operation of Password Writeback. The ADSync source will describe operations and issues related to setting passwords in your AD environment.

## Troubleshoot Password Writeback connectivity

If you are experiencing service interruptions with the Password Writeback component of Azure AD Connect, here are some quick steps you can take to resolve this:

 - [Restart the Azure AD Connect Sync Service](#restart-the-azure-AD-sync-service)
 - [Disable and re-enable the Password Writeback feature](#disable-and-re-enable-the-password-writeback-feature)
 - [Install the latest Azure AD Connect release](#install-the-latest-azure-ad-connect-release)
 - [Troubleshoot Password Writeback](#troubleshoot-password-writeback)

In general, we recommend that you execute these steps in the order above in order to recover your service in the most rapid manner.

### Restart the Azure AD Connect Sync Service
Restarting the Azure AD Connect Sync Service can help to resolve connectivity issues or other transient issues with the service.

 1.	As an administrator, click **Start** on the server running **Azure AD Connect**.
 2.	Type **“services.msc”** in the search box and press **Enter**.
 3.	Look for the **Microsoft Azure AD Connect** entry.
 4.	Right-click on the service entry, click **Restart**, and wait for the operation to complete.

    ![][002]

These steps will re-establish your connection with the cloud service and resolve any interruptions you may be experiencing.  If restarting the Sync Service does not resolve your issue, we recommend that you try to disable and re-enable the Password Writeback feature as a next step.

### Disable and re-enable the Password Writeback feature
Disabling and re-enabling the Password Writeback feature can help to resolve connectivity issues.

 1.	As an administrator, open the **Azure AD Connect configuration wizard**.
 2.	On the **Connect to Azure AD** dialog, enter your **Azure AD global admin credentials**
 3.	On the **Connect to AD DS** dialog, enter your **AD Domain Services admin credentials**.
 4.	On the **Uniquely identifying your users** dialog, click the **Next** button.
 5.	On the **Optional features** dialog, uncheck the **Password write-back** checkbox.

    ![][003]

 6.	Click **Next** through the remaining dialog pages without changing anything until you get to the **Ready to configure** page.
 7.	Ensure that the configure page shows the **Password write-back option as disabled** and then click the green **Configure** button to commit your changes.
 8.	On the **Finished** dialog, deselect the **Synchronize now** option, and then click **Finish** to close the wizard.
 9.	Re-open the **Azure AD Connect configuration wizard**.
 10.	**Repeat steps 2-8**, except ensure you **check the Password write-back option** on the **Optional features** screen to re-enable the service.

    ![][004]

These steps will re-establish your connection with our cloud service and resolve any interruptions you may be experiencing. 

If disabling and re-enabling the Password Writeback feature does not resolve your issue, we recommend that you try to re-install Azure AD Connect as a next step.

### Install the latest Azure AD Connect release
Re-installing the Azure AD Connect package will resolve any configuration issues which may be affecting your ability to either connect to our cloud services or to manage passwords in your local AD environment. 
We recommend, you perform this step only after attempting the first two steps described above.

 1.	Download the latest version of Azure AD Connect [here](active-directory-aadconnect.md#download-azure-ad-connect).
 2.	Since you have already installed Azure AD Connect, you will only need to perform an in-place upgrade to update your Azure AD Connect installation to the latest version.
 3.	Execute the downloaded package and follow the on-screen instructions to update your Azure AD Connect machine.  No additional manual steps are required unless you have customized the out of box sync rules, in which case you should **back these up before proceeding with upgrade and manually re-deploy them after you are finished**.

These steps will re-establish your connection with our cloud service and resolve any interruptions you may be experiencing. 

If installing the latest version of the Azure AD Connect server does not resolve your issue, we recommend that you try disabling and re-enabling Password Writeback as a final step after installing the latest sync QFE. 

If that does not resolve your issue, then we recommend that you take a look at [Troubleshoot Password Writeback](#troubleshoot-password-writeback) and the [Azure AD password Management FAQ](active-directory-passwords-faq.md) to see if your issue may be discussed there.
