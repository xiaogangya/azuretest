# Configure automatic device registration for Windows 7 domain joined devices

As an IT admin, you can configure your Windows 7 domain joined devices to automatically register with Azure AD. To do so, you must deploy the device registration software package to your Windows 7 domain joined devices using a software distribution system such as System Center Configuration Manager. Be sure to read through and complete the prerequisites listed in Automatic Device Registration with Azure Active Directory for Windows Domain-Joined Devices.

##Installing the device registration software package on Windows 7 domain joined devices

Device registration for Windows 7 is available as a downloadable MSI package. The package must be installed on Windows 7 machines that are joined to an Active Directory Domain. You should deploy the package using a software distribution system such as System Center Configuration Manager. The MSI package supports the standard silent install options using the /quiet parameter.
The software package is available for download at the Microsoft Connect website. Here you can select and then download Workplace Join for Windows 7.

## Workplace Join with Azure Active Directory
Device registration for Windows 7 domain joined devices does not require or include a user interface. Once installed on the machine, any domain user that logs into the machine will be automatically and silently registered with a device object in Azure AD. There will be one device object in Azure AD for every registered user of the physical device.

The installer creates a Scheduled Task on the system that runs in the userâ€™s context and is triggered on user sign-in. The task silently registers the user and device with Azure AD after the user signs-in is complete. 
The Scheduled Task can be found in the Task Scheduler Library under **Microsoft** > **Workplace Join**.
The task will run and register any and all Active Directory users that sign-in to the machine.
The following illustration lists the step-by-step process for automatic device registration.

1. A user (information worker) logs on to a Windows 7 client computer using Active Directory domain credentials.
1. The Workplace Join scheduled task is executed.
1. The user is silently authenticated with AD FS using Windows Integrated Authentication.
1. The Windows 7 PC is registered to the user in Azure AD.
1. A device object and certificate is created in Azure AD. The object represents the user@device.
1. The Workplace Join certificate is stored on the machine.
