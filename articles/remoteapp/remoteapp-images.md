# What is in the Azure RemoteApp template images?

Your Azure RemoteApp subscription includes three template images:


- Windows Server 2012
- Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus (Office 365 subscription required)
- Microsoft Office 2013 Professional Plus (trial only)

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT]Your Azure RemoteApp subscription grants you access to the software in the images, with the exception of Office 365 ProPlus, which requires a separate subscription, and Office 2013, which cannot be used in production. This means that you can share the programs or apps on the template images with your users. For example, if you create a collection that uses the Windows Server 2012 R2 image, you can publish System Center Endpoint Protection for users to access through RemoteApp.
> 
> Check out the [RemoteApp licensing details](remoteapp-licensing.md) for more information. And [Using Office with Azure RemoteApp](remoteapp-o365.md) for the Office licensing info.

Read on for details on what each image contains.

Also check out the new article, [How to use your Office 365 subscription with Azure RemoteApp](remoteapp-officesubscription.md).

Note that you need to license Office 365 ProPlus, Visio Pro, and Project Pro separately - they each have their own license.
