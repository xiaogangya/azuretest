# Modify the DATA 0 network interface settings on your StorSimple device

## Overview

Your Microsoft Azure StorSimple device has six network interfaces, from DATA 0 to DATA 5. The DATA 0 interface is always configured through Windows PowerShell interface or the serial console, and is automatically cloud-enabled. DATA 0 interface is first configured through setup wizard during the initial deployment of the StorSimple device. When the device is in an operational mode, you may need to reconfigure DATA 0 settings. This tutorial provides two methods to modify DATA 0 network settings, both through Windows PowerShell for StorSimple.

After reading this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Modify DATA 0 network setting through the setup wizard
- Modify DATA 0 network settings through `Set-HcsNetInterface` cmdlet


## Modify DATA 0 network settings through setup wizard
You can reconfigure DATA 0 network settings by connecting to the Windows PowerShell interface of your StorSimple device and launching a setup wizard session. Perform the following steps to modify DATA 0 settings:

#### To modify DATA 0 network settings through setup wizard

1. In the serial console menu, choose option 1, **Log in with full access**. When prompted provide the **device administrator password**. The default password is `Password1`.

2. At the command prompt, type:


	`Invoke-HcsSetupWizard`

3. A setup wizard will appear to help you configure the DATA 0 interface of your device. Provide new values for the IP address, gateway, and netmask.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The fixed controllers IPs will need to be reconfigured through the **Configure** page of the StorSimple device in the Azure Management Portal. For more information, go to [Modify network interfaces](storsimple-modify-device-config.md#modify-network-interfaces).


## Modify DATA 0 network settings through Set-HcsNetInterface cmdlet
An alternate way to reconfigure DATA 0 network interface is through the use of  the `Set-HcsNetInterface` cmdlet. The cmdlet is executed from the Windows PowerShell interface of your StorSimple device. Perform the following steps to modify the DATA 0 settings: 

#### To modify DATA 0 network settings through the Set-HcsNetInterface cmdlet

1. In the serial console menu, choose option 1, **Log in with full access**. When prompted provide the device administrator password. The default password is `Password1`.

2. At the command prompt, type:

	`Set-HCSNetInterface -InterfaceAlias Data0 -IPv4Address <> -IPv4Netmask <> -IPv4Gateway <> -Controller0IPv4Address <> -Controller1IPv4Address <> -IsiScsiEnabled 1 -IsCloudEnabled 1`
	
    In the angled brackets, type the following values for DATA 0:
											
	- IPv4 address
	
	- IPv4 gateway
	
	- IPv4 subnet mask
	
	- Fixed IPv4 address for Controller 0

	- Fixed IPv4 address for Controller 1

## Next steps

To configure network interfaces other than DATA 0, you can use the [Configure page in the Management Portal](storsimple-modify-device-config.md). If you experience any issues when configuring your network interfaces, refer to [Troubleshoot deployment issues](storsimple-troubleshoot-deployment.md).
