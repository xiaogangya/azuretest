# Register your apps for Google login with Mobile Services

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-selector-register-identity-provider](../../includes/mobile-services-selector-register-identity-provider.md)]

This topic shows you how to register your apps to be able to use Google to authenticate with Azure Mobile Services.

>[AZURE.NOTE] This tutorial is about [Azure Mobile Services](http://azure.microsoft.com/services/mobile-services/), a solution to help you build scalable mobile applications for any platform. Mobile Services makes it easy to sync data, authenticate users, and send push notifications. This page supports the [Get Started with Authentication](mobile-services-ios-get-started-users.md) tutorial, which shows how to sign in users to your app. 
<br/>If this is your first experience with Mobile Services, please complete the tutorial [Get Started with Mobile Services](mobile-services-ios-get-started.md).

To complete the procedure in this topic, you must have a Google account that has a verified email address. To create a new Google account, go to <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268302" target="_blank">accounts.google.com</a>.

3. Navigate to the [Google apis](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268303) website, sign-in with your Google account credentials, click **Create Project**, provide a **Project name**, then click **Create**.

4. In the left navigation bar, click **API & Auth**, then under **Social APIs** click **Google+ API** > **Enable API**.

5. Click **API & Auth** > **Credentials** > **OAuth consent screen**, then select your **Email address**,  enter a **Product Name**, and click **Save**.

6. In the **Credentials** tab, click **Add credentials** > **OAuth 2.0 client ID**, then select **Web application**.

7. Type your mobile service URL in **Authorized JavaScript Origins**, replace the generated URL in **Authorized Redirect URI** with the URL of your mobile service appended with the path `/login/google`, and then click **Create client ID**.

	>[AZURE.NOTE] For a .NET backend mobile service published to Azure by using Visual Studio, the redirect URL is the URL of your mobile service appended with the path _signin-google_ your mobile service as a .NET service, such as `https://todolist.azure-mobile.net/signin-google`. 
	&nbsp;
	
8. On the next screen, make a note of the values of the client ID and client secret.

    > [AZURE.IMPORTANT] The client secret is an important security credential. Do not share this secret with anyone or distribute it within a client application.

You are now ready to configure your mobile service to use Google sign-in for authentication in your app.
