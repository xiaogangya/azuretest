# Common Azure Stream Analytics Query Patterns  #

## Introduction ##
Queries in Azure Stream Analytics are expressed in a SQL-like query language, which is documented [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn834998.aspx).  This document outlines solutions to several common query patterns based on real world scenarios.  It is a work in progress and will continue to be updated with new patterns on an ongoing basis.

## Basics ##

## Data type conversions ##
**Description**: Define the types of the properties on the input stream.
e.g. Car weight is coming on the input stream as strings and needs to be converted to INT to perform SUM it up.

**Input**:

| Make | Time | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Honda | 2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z | "1000" |
| Honda | 2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z | "2000" |

**Output**:

| Make | Weight |
| --- | --- |
| Honda | 3000 |

**Solution**:

	SELECT
    	Make,
    	SUM(CAST(Weight AS BIGINT)) AS Weight
	FROM
    	Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
	GROUP BY
		Make,
    	TumblingWindow(second, 10)

**Explanation**:
Use a CAST statement on the Weight field to specify its type (see the list of supported Data Types [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn835065.aspx)).

## Using Like/Not like to do pattern matching ##
**Description**: Check that a field value on the event matches a certain pattern
e.g. Return license plates that start with A and end with 9

**Input**:

| Make | LicensePlate | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Honda | ABC-123 | 2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Toyota | AAA-999 | 2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Nissan | ABC-369 | 2015-01-01T00:00:03.0000000Z |

**Output**:

| Make | LicensePlate | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Toyota | AAA-999 | 2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Nissan | ABC-369 | 2015-01-01T00:00:03.0000000Z |

**Solution**:

	SELECT
    	*
	FROM
    	Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
	WHERE
    	LicensePlate LIKE 'A%9'

**Explanation**:
Use the LIKE statement to check that the LicensePlate field value starts with A then has any string of zero or more characters and it ends with 9. 

## Specify logic for different cases/values (CASE statements) ##
**Description**: Provide different computation for a field based on some criteria.
e.g. Provide a string description for how many cars passed of the same make with a special case for 1.

**Input**:

| Make | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Honda | 2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Toyota | 2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Toyota | 2015-01-01T00:00:03.0000000Z |

**Output**:

| CarsPassed | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Honda | 2015-01-01T00:00:10.0000000Z |
| 2 Toyotas | 2015-01-01T00:00:10.0000000Z |

**Solution**:

    SELECT
    	CASE
			WHEN COUNT(*) = 1 THEN CONCAT('1 ', Make)
			ELSE CONCAT(CAST(COUNT(*) AS NVARCHAR(MAX)), ' ', Make, 's')
		END AS CarsPassed,
		System.TimeStamp AS Time
	FROM
		Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
	GROUP BY
		Make,
		TumblingWindow(second, 10)

**Explanation**:
The CASE clause allows us to provide a different computation based on some criteria (in our case the count of cars in the aggregate window).

## Send data to multiple outputs ##
**Description**: Send data to multiple output targets from a single job.
e.g. Analyze data for a threshold-based alert and archive all events to blob storage

**Input**:

| Make | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Honda	| 2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Honda	| 2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Toyota | 2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Toyota | 2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Toyota | 2015-01-01T00:00:03.0000000Z |

**Output1**:

| Make | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Honda | 2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Honda | 2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Toyota | 2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Toyota | 2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Toyota | 2015-01-01T00:00:03.0000000Z |

**Output2**:

| Make | Time | Count |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Toyota | 2015-01-01T00:00:10.0000000Z | 3 |

**Solution**:

	SELECT
		*
	INTO
		ArchiveOutput
	FROM
		Input TIMESTAMP BY Time

	SELECT
		Make,
		System.TimeStamp AS Time,
		COUNT(*) AS [Count]
	INTO
		AlertOutput
	FROM
		Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
	GROUP BY
		Make,
		TumblingWindow(second, 10)
	HAVING
		[Count] >= 3

**Explanation**:
The INTO clause tells Stream Analytics which of the outputs to write the data from this statement.
The first query is a pass-through of the data we received to an output that we named ArchiveOutput.
The second query does some simple aggregation and filtering and sends the results to a downstream alerting system.
*Note*: You can also reuse results of CTEs (i.e. WITH statements) in multiple output statements – this has the added benefit of opening less readers to the input source.
e.g. 

	WITH AllRedCars AS (
		SELECT
			*
		FROM
			Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
		WHERE
			Color = 'red'
	)
	SELECT * INTO HondaOutput FROM AllRedCars WHERE Make = 'Honda'
	SELECT * INTO ToyotaOutput FROM AllRedCars WHERE Make = 'Toyota'

## Patterns ##

## Counting unique values
**Description**: count the number of unique field values that appear in the stream within a time window.
e.g. How many unique make of cars passed through the toll booth in a 2 second window?

**Input**:

| Make | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Honda | 2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Honda | 2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Toyota | 2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Toyota | 2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Toyota | 2015-01-01T00:00:03.0000000Z |

**Output:**

| Count | Time |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | 2015-01-01T00:00:02.000Z |
| 1 | 2015-01-01T00:00:04.000Z |

**Solution:**

	WITH Makes AS (
	    SELECT
	        Make,
	        COUNT(*) AS CountMake
	    FROM
	        Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
	    GROUP BY
	          Make,
	          TumblingWindow(second, 2)
	)
	SELECT
	    COUNT(*) AS Count,
	    System.TimeStamp AS Time
	FROM
	    Makes
	GROUP BY
	    TumblingWindow(second, 1)


**Explanation:**
We do an initial aggregation to get unique makes with their count over the window.
We then do an aggregation of how many makes we got – given all unique values in a window get the same timestamp then the second aggregation window needs to be minimal to not aggregate 2 windows from the first step.

## Determine if a value has changed ##
**Description**: Look at a previous value to determine if it is different than the current value
e.g. Is the previous car on the Toll Road the same make as the current car?

**Input**:

| Make | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Honda | 2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Toyota | 2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |

**Output**:

| Make | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Toyota | 2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |

**Solution**:

	SELECT
		Make,
		Time
	FROM
		Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
	WHERE
		LAG(Make, 1) OVER (LIMIT DURATION(minute, 1)) <> Make

**Explanation**:
Use LAG to peek into the input stream one event back and get the Make value. Then compare it to the Make on the current event and output the event if they are different.

## Find first event in a window ##
**Description**: Find first car in every 10 minute interval?

**Input**:

| LicensePlate | Make | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DXE 5291 | Honda | 2015-07-27T00:00:05.0000000Z |
| YZK 5704 | Ford | 2015-07-27T00:02:17.0000000Z |
| RMV 8282 | Honda | 2015-07-27T00:05:01.0000000Z |
| YHN 6970 | Toyota | 2015-07-27T00:06:00.0000000Z |
| VFE 1616 | Toyota | 2015-07-27T00:09:31.0000000Z |
| QYF 9358 | Honda | 2015-07-27T00:12:02.0000000Z |
| MDR 6128 | BMW | 2015-07-27T00:13:45.0000000Z |

**Output**:

| LicensePlate | Make | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DXE 5291 | Honda | 2015-07-27T00:00:05.0000000Z |
| QYF 9358 | Honda | 2015-07-27T00:12:02.0000000Z |

**Solution**:

	SELECT 
		LicensePlate,
		Make,
		Time
	FROM 
		Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
	WHERE 
		IsFirst(minute, 10) = 1

Now let’s change the problem and find first car of particular Make in every 10 minute interval.

| LicensePlate | Make | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DXE 5291 | Honda | 2015-07-27T00:00:05.0000000Z |
| YZK 5704 | Ford | 2015-07-27T00:02:17.0000000Z |
| YHN 6970 | Toyota | 2015-07-27T00:06:00.0000000Z |
| QYF 9358 | Honda | 2015-07-27T00:12:02.0000000Z |
| MDR 6128 | BMW | 2015-07-27T00:13:45.0000000Z |

**Solution**:

	SELECT 
		LicensePlate,
		Make,
		Time
	FROM 
		Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
	WHERE 
		IsFirst(minute, 10) OVER (PARTITION BY Make) = 1

## Find last event in a window ##
**Description**: Find last car in every 10 minute interval.

**Input**:

| LicensePlate | Make | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DXE 5291 | Honda | 2015-07-27T00:00:05.0000000Z |
| YZK 5704 | Ford | 2015-07-27T00:02:17.0000000Z |
| RMV 8282 | Honda | 2015-07-27T00:05:01.0000000Z |
| YHN 6970 | Toyota | 2015-07-27T00:06:00.0000000Z |
| VFE 1616 | Toyota | 2015-07-27T00:09:31.0000000Z |
| QYF 9358 | Honda | 2015-07-27T00:12:02.0000000Z |
| MDR 6128 | BMW | 2015-07-27T00:13:45.0000000Z |

**Output**:

| LicensePlate | Make | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VFE 1616 | Toyota | 2015-07-27T00:09:31.0000000Z |
| MDR 6128 | BMW | 2015-07-27T00:13:45.0000000Z |

**Solution**:

	WITH LastInWindow AS
	(
		SELECT 
			MAX(Time) AS LastEventTime
		FROM 
			Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
		GROUP BY 
			TumblingWindow(minute, 10)
	)
	SELECT 
		Input.LicensePlate,
		Input.Make,
		Input.Time
	FROM
		Input TIMESTAMP BY Time 
		INNER JOIN LastInWindow
		ON DATEDIFF(minute, Input, LastInWindow) BETWEEN 0 AND 10
		AND Input.Time = LastInWindow.LastEventTime

**Explanation**:
There are two steps in the query – the first one finds latest timestamp in 10 minute windows. The second step joins results of the first query with original stream to find events matching last timestamps in each window. 

## Detect the absence of events ##
**Description**: Check that a stream has no value that matches a certain criteria.
e.g. Have 2 consecutive cars from the same make entered the toll road within 90 seconds?

**Input**:

| Make | LicensePlate | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Honda | ABC-123 | 2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Honda | AAA-999 | 2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Toyota | DEF-987 | 2015-01-01T00:00:03.0000000Z |
| Honda | GHI-345 | 2015-01-01T00:00:04.0000000Z |

**Output**:

| Make | Time | CurrentCarLicensePlate | FirstCarLicensePlate | FirstCarTime |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Honda | 2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z | AAA-999 | ABC-123 | 2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |

**Solution**:

	SELECT
	    Make,
	    Time,
	    LicensePlate AS CurrentCarLicensePlate,
	    LAG(LicensePlate, 1) OVER (LIMIT DURATION(second, 90)) AS FirstCarLicensePlate,
	    LAG(Time, 1) OVER (LIMIT DURATION(second, 90)) AS FirstCarTime
	FROM
	    Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
	WHERE
	    LAG(Make, 1) OVER (LIMIT DURATION(second, 90)) = Make

**Explanation**:
Use LAG to peek into the input stream one event back and get the Make value. Then compare it to the Make on the current event and output the event if they are the same and use LAG to get data about the previous car.

## Detect duration of a condition ##
**Description**: Find out how long a condition occurred for.
e.g. Suppose that a bug that resulted in all cars having an incorrect (above 20,000 pounds) – we want to compute the duration of the bug.

**Input**:

| Make | Time | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Honda | 2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z | 2000 |
| Toyota | 2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z | 25000 |
| Honda | 2015-01-01T00:00:03.0000000Z | 26000 |
| Toyota | 2015-01-01T00:00:04.0000000Z | 25000 |
| Honda | 2015-01-01T00:00:05.0000000Z | 26000 |
| Toyota | 2015-01-01T00:00:06.0000000Z | 25000 |
| Honda | 2015-01-01T00:00:07.0000000Z | 26000 |
| Toyota | 2015-01-01T00:00:08.0000000Z | 2000 |

**Output**:

| StartFault | EndFault | FaultDurationSeconds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z | 2015-01-01T00:00:08.0000000Z | 7 |
| 2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z | 2015-01-01T00:00:08.0000000Z | 7 |
| 2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z | 2015-01-01T00:00:08.0000000Z | 7 |
| 2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z | 2015-01-01T00:00:08.0000000Z | 7 |
| 2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z | 2015-01-01T00:00:08.0000000Z | 7 |
| 2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z | 2015-01-01T00:00:08.0000000Z | 7 |

**Solution**:

	SELECT
	    PrevGood.Time AS StartFault,
	    ThisGood.Time AS Endfault,
	    DATEDIFF(second, PrevGood.Time, ThisGood.Time) AS FaultDuraitonSeconds
	FROM
	    Input AS ThisGood TIMESTAMP BY Time
	    INNER JOIN Input AS PrevGood TIMESTAMP BY Time
	    ON DATEDIFF(second, PrevGood, ThisGood) BETWEEN 1 AND 3600
	    AND PrevGood.Weight < 20000
	    INNER JOIN Input AS Bad TIMESTAMP BY Time
	    ON DATEDIFF(second, PrevGood, Bad) BETWEEN 1 AND 3600
	    AND DATEDIFF(second, Bad, ThisGood) BETWEEN 1 AND 3600
	    AND Bad.Weight >= 20000
	    LEFT JOIN Input AS MidGood TIMESTAMP BY Time
	    ON DATEDIFF(second, PrevGood, MidGood) BETWEEN 1 AND 3600
	    AND DATEDIFF(second, MidGood, ThisGood) BETWEEN 1 AND 3600
	    AND MidGood.Weight < 20000
	WHERE
	    ThisGood.Weight < 20000
	    AND MidGood.Weight IS NULL

**Explanation**:
We are looking for 2 good events with a bad event in between and without a good event in between which means the 2 events are the first events before and after at least 1 bad event. Getting 2 good events with 1 bad event in the middle is simple using 2 JOINs and validating that we get good -> bad -> good by checking the weight and comparing the time stamps. 

Using what we learned on “LEFT Outer Join to include NULLs or to do absence of events” we know how to check that no good event has occurred between the 2 good events we picked up.

Composing those together and we get good -> bad -> good with no other good event in between. We can now compute the duration between the beginning and end good events which gives us the duration of the bug.
