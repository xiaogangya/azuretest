Follow these steps to create a new App Service gateway to handle authentication. If you already have a gateway in the same resource group, you do not need to complete this section.

1. Visit the [Azure Portal]. Click **Browse All** > **Mobile Apps** > the backend that you just created. Click **Settings** > **Mobile** > **User authentication**. 

2. You will be presented with a blade for creating your gateway. You do not need to enter any information, and the name of this gateway is automatically generated for you. Click **Create**.

Next, you will use this gateway with an authentication provider.
