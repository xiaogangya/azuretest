## What is Blob Storage

Azure Blob storage is a service for storing large amounts of
unstructured data, such as text or binary data, that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via
HTTP or HTTPS. You can use Blob storage to expose data publicly to the world, or
to store application data privately.

Common uses of Blob storage include:

-   Serving images or documents directly to a browser
-   Storing files for distributed access
-   Streaming video and audio
-   Performing secure backup and disaster recovery
-   Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service

## Blob service concepts

The Blob service contains the following components:

![Blob1][Blob1]

-   **Storage Account:** All access to Azure Storage is done
    through a storage account. See [Azure Storage Scalability and Performance Targets](storage-scalability-targets.md) for details about storage account capacity.

-   **Container:** A container provides a grouping of a set of blobs.
    All blobs must be in a container. An account can contain an
    unlimited number of containers. A container can store an unlimited
    number of blobs.

-   **Blob:** A file of any type and size. Azure Storage offers three types of blobs: block blobs, page blobs, and append blobs.
    
	*Block blobs* are ideal for storing text or binary files, such as documents and media files. *Append blobs* are similar to block blobs in that they are made up of blocks, but they are optimized for append operations, so they are useful for logging scenarios. A single block blob or append blob can contain up to 50,000 blocks of up to 4 MB each, for a total size of slightly more than 195 GB (4 MB X 50,000).
    
	*Page blobs* can be up to 1 TB in size, and are more efficient for frequent read/write operations. Azure Virtual Machines use page blobs as OS and data disks.

## Naming and referencing containers and blobs

You can address a blob in your storage account using the following URL format:
   
    http://<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>/<blob-name>  
      
For example, here is a URL that addresses one of the blobs in the diagram above:  

    http://sally.blob.core.windows.net/movies/MOV1.AVI

### Container naming rules

A container name must be a valid DNS name and conform to the following rules:

- A container name must be all lowercase.
- Container names must start with a letter or number, and can contain only letters, numbers, and the dash (-) character.
- Every dash (-) character must be immediately preceded and followed by a letter or number; consecutive dashes are not permitted in container names.
- Container names must be from 3 through 63 characters long.

### Blob naming rules

A blob name must conform to the following rules:

- A blob name can contain any combination of characters.
- A blob name must be at least one character long and cannot be more than 1,024 characters long.
- Blob names are case-sensitive.
- Reserved URL characters must be properly escaped.
- The number of path segments comprising the blob name cannot exceed 254. A path segment is the string between consecutive delimiter characters (*e.g.*, the forward slash '/') that corresponds to the name of a virtual directory.

The Blob service is based on a flat storage scheme. You can create a virtual hierarchy by specifying a character or string delimiter within the blob name to create a virtual hierarchy. For example, the following list shows some valid and unique blob names:

	/a
	/a.txt
	/a/b
	/a/b.txt

You can use the delimiter character to list blobs hierarchically.
