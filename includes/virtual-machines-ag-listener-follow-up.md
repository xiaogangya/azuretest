After the availability group listener is created, it may be necessary to adjust the **RegisterAllProvidersIP** and **HostRecordTTL** cluster parameters for the listener resource.  These parameters may reduce reconnection time after a failover which may prevent connection timeouts. For more information on these parameters, as well as sample code, see [Create or Configure an Availability Group Listener](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh213080.aspx#MultiSubnetFailover).
