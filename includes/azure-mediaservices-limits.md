<sup>1</sup> You can request to update the limits for this quota by opening a support ticket. Do not create more AMS accounts to increase limits, instead submit a support ticket.

<sup>2</sup> This number includes queued, finished, active, and canceled jobs. It does not include deleted jobs. You can delete the old jobs using **IJob.Delete** or the **DELETE** HTTP request.

<sup>3</sup> When making a request to list Job entities, a maximum of 1,000 will be returned per request. If you need to keep track of all submitted Jobs, you can use top/skip as described in [OData system query options](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/gg309461.aspx).

<sup>4</sup> Locators are not designed for managing per-user access control. To give different access rights to individual users, use Digital Rights Management (DRM) solutions.

<sup>5</sup> The storage accounts must be from the same Azure subscription.
